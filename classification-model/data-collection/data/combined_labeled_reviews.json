They are open everyday, from 11am- 8pm! Aunty makes and takes the orders herself so please be patient with them as queuing time might take a bit longer during peak periods. Their prices are affordable and soup is complimentary too. The menu has a wide variety that also caters to kids and she fries the fried items upon orders so you are guaranteed freshness. I am a picky chicken rice eater so her stall is my go- to whenever I'm around the area.",

The high ceilings, exposed beams, and striking vertical pillars give the space a grand industrial-chic feel, complemented by warm amber lighting and neatly set tables. The open kitchen allows diners to watch the chefs in action, adding an engaging, lively atmosphere.\n\nThe food presentation is elegant and minimalist, allowing the quality of the ingredients to shine. The slices of beef are cooked to a perfect medium-rare, with a delicate char on the outside and a juicy, tender center, paired simply with fresh greens for a clean, balanced plate. Another standout is the richly glazed beef-topped toast, crowned with tart pickles and fresh chives‚Äîa harmonious combination of sweet, tangy, and savory notes.\n\nThe playful touch of charred marshmallows on skewers hints at the restaurant‚Äôs creative flair, blending nostalgic comfort with gourmet technique.\n\nService is very attentive and professional, with the chefs clearly passionate about their craft.

Is because I totally loved that flavour and slowly tasted the wonderful wings flavour.\n\nEel and bone marrow, like the photos shows..seems normal like a unagi sushi , but this is done smoked flavour glazed in the special miso sauce that I consider 5 üåü against any omakase japanese resturant.   The bone marrow was hidden as a base that did not really over power the eel.\n\nMain course was WA Marron grill to perfection, like medium rare..that is preserved the softness of the body, the glazed sauce was amazing don‚Äôt even remember what was it.\n\nFinally the Australian steak, it was ok, lack the punch of a wow for a steak\n\nConcluded with smoked lava cake, this is totally amazingly different with a strong smoky smoke in ur mouth,  of course it has to be eaten with the ice cream.\n\nI am thrilled by the different presentation of course that resembles smoky identity yet letting each element of food be amazingly created to refine texture and taste.",

Slots are fully booked within a few hours. Tips for those looking to make reservation.\n\nFood wise, what I love:\nBeef cube roll (ribeye steak)\nGrissini,\nBeef and uni\nFennel (root vegetable)\nBeef cube roll is the best steak we have ever had (we have ordered 200g). It was simple yet masterfully done. Right level of tenderness, high quality beef.\nTheir small dishes are surprisingly nice for a steak house. Right balance in flavour, leaving you wanting to come back for more.\n\nFor individuals who prefer food's natural flavour and not too overpowering taste, I would not recommend:\nFlat iron\nMarron (small lobster)\nThese two dishes are too flavourful for me - flavours are too rich that it was hard for me to finish my portion.\nTheir sourdough bread is too hard for me as well, I couldn't chew through the crust and it's hard and chewy. Had better bread elsewhere.\n\nTheir service was excellent! We were served by Tim Chew. He was very patient and detailed in offering food recommendations to us. Very genuine guy who made our visit there very pleasant and memorable. The service crew is generally very nice and attentive to details.\n\nOverall, it is recommended to lower your expectations to this extremely hard to book restaurant, and you will be pleasantly surprised with the dining experience that you may have. As the dishes here varied (from super flavourful/rich to a more balanced taste), it is good to choose your side and let the service crew know such that you can have the recommended dishes accordingly. We couldn't make up our mind hence we tried the whole spectrum.",

Service was outstanding. Great fit out and atmosphere, overall a very pleasurable experience.\n\nI can very much recommend trying to get a spot at the chefs table to watch all the magic happen right in front of you. Also you can chat with them whilst they are working. (In fact I recommend doing this at all restaurants that offer it, I have never had a bad experience).\n\nThanks again",

My favourites would be the smoked quail eggs, followed by the steak frites, then the berry tart. However, everything was well done. Except for the leeks with hazelnuts perhaps, wasnt much of a fan of that as it was a buttery dish and it wasnt served that hot. Having said that, the experience was fun and worth it. I enjoyed savouring each dish, the lovely ambience in the restaurant (there is a 2 hour max seating time, but there are outdoor seats if you feel like exceeding), and the friendly service. It was roughly 200+ per person if you order one drink. I also have chicken allergy and they gladly replaced one of my set menu dishes with a lamb one. The whole menu was quite filling. The tenderloin was amazing - melts in your mouth!",

Initially, attempting to secure a reservation more than a month before our trip proved challenging, as they were fully booked. However, a stroke of luck came our way when a fellow foodie from one of my groups suggested trying a walk-in. Intrigued, we decided to forgo a hosted dinner and give it a shot. To our surprise, we arrived at 6:15 pm, and within 30 minutes, we were comfortably seated at a table - the staff informed us we had until 8:15 pm. It felt like we had won a small lottery, and the anticipation for the evening grew.\n\nThe atmosphere was everything we hoped for - chill, relaxed, and with a front-row seat to the culinary action. We enjoyed watching the chefs expertly grill our dishes, adding to the overall dining experience. The two-hour time frame was more than enough for us, and the feeling of exclusivity made the evening even more special. ü•∞\n\nAs for the food, it was a symphony of flavors. From the perfectly cooked steak to the delightful cocktails, every dish was a masterpiece. The ambiance, coupled with the superb culinary skills on display, created a dining experience that was truly sublime. Burnt Ends exceeded our expectations, and I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary adventure in Singapore.",

The warmly lit, narrow dining hall accommodates just over 170 diners, making advance reservations a must. Furnishings are comfortable, and tableware is immaculate. Decor strikes a balance between contemporary minimalist and traditional Oriental aesthetics, creating a sophisticated yet welcoming ambience.\n.\nService is attentive and efficient. Staff politely greet guests, showing them quickly to their seats, and demonstrating astute product knowledge with descriptions of the menu and its offerings. I note that staff proactively offer to clear finished plates throughout the meal, cleaning up quickly when diners leave. Advance reservations are also a breeze through the online platform.\n.\nFood is Chinese Cantonese cuisine. The kitchen is headed by Chef Aaron Tan, who serves up a dim sum ala-carte buffet on weekends and public holidays, priced at SGD $98++ per person.

With a neon of love poem displayed beside the bar, one that is too heartfelt not to be relatable.\n\nAnyways, the food here is rather fantastic! Joining the gang of gastronomic restaurants in Duxton Hill with the same feverish passion.\n\nI was told to try the steak because it‚Äôs ‚ÄôA steak house‚Äô but honestly the steaks are just above average and personally it isn‚Äôt one of the top rankings group in Singapore. BUT their speciality is truly in things related to sauces.\n\nü¶™ Hokkaido Scallop\nLarge soft scallops resting on so much fresh rocks of raw salts that can maybe, it can somewhat revive the death scallops. The sauce here is lightly spice but some sort buttery taste. It‚Äôs seriously good!\n\nü•© Ribeye\nSoft texture but don‚Äôt expect much from a ‚ÄòGrain fed‚Äô cow. If you‚Äôre gonna get a sauce, Lo & Behold‚Äî The peppercorn isn‚Äôt your average pepper sauce! If they were to cook black pepper crab with it, JUMBO Seafood will lose at least half its customers!\n\nüç∞ Tiramisu\nSuper soft & wet cake (From heart broken chefs?) with lots of cream but the last layer at the bottom contains so much Kahlua or whatever secret booze, that you‚Äôre very much likely to forget who your lover is/was for 24 hours‚Äî It‚Äôs the Italian style.\n\nA lush greenery vibes with modern twist. Love the thoughtful seats with spine-level cushion. Chair and table was of perfect height combination for Asian descent. Attentive staff hustling all over. Great recipes‚Äî I would certainly invest my dollar in the sauce based dish.\n\nThanks Hari (Don‚Äôt burn more of your hair from performing that flamboyant flaming dessert) & crew! üå∏ü§µüèªüë®üèª‚Äçüç≥üëçüèª",

It‚Äôs little touches like that which make such a difference. The staff really made us feel looked after, and their attention to detail was impressive.\n\nIf there‚Äôs one thing to relook into, it might be the furniture. The chairs, while beautiful, were a bit uncomfortable ‚Äì the height with the table felt awkward, and the lack of proper support meant that many guests (including us) seemed to be sitting in strange postures.\n\nOverall, we left so impressed with the food, the service, and the overall atmosphere.

It was our first time there, but it really felt like we‚Äôve already been there several times before - the level of hospitality by the entire team was truly incredible! Big shoutout to Chef Alastair, Martin, Burn, Gary who looked after us so well & Jea-ann who welcomed us very warmly. We will be back very soon indeed for more!",

    "text": "Bottega Di Carna stands out among celebrity restaurants, defying the usual underwhelming experiences that come with fame. Nestled within the Mondrian Singapore Duxton hotel, this contemporary Italian eatery is the outpost of the famed Tuscan butcher Dario Cecchini, hailed for his appearances on Netflix's Chef's Table and his impressive clientele including Elton John, Anthony Bourdain, and King Charles. Dubbed the \"World's Greatest Butcher\" by the New York Times, Cecchini infuses the restaurant with his mastery of butchery and bold creativity. The menu highlights flame-kissed meats alongside homemade pastas, charcuterie, fresh seafood, and a variety of classic and unconventional meat cuts.\n\nAppetizers dazzle with options like zesty Seabass Crudo and perfectly crisped golden Calamari, while the savoury, cheesy Parmigiana delights the palate. Vegetarian offerings such as cold zucchini noodles with basil pesto and roasted cauliflower with spiced honey, almond, thyme, and garlic provide flavourful options for non-meat eaters. Pastas are authentic: the Pici Bolognese comes with a rich and hearty Bolognese sauce simmered to perfection with aromatic onions, garlic, and tomatoes, mingling with savory shredded beef braised for 8 hours till tender, finished with a touch of fresh herbs and a hint of red wine - kudos to Chef Kenny Huang who honed his craft in Turin for several years.\n\nSeated at the open kitchen, diners can observe the culinary magic firsthand. The restaurant's vibrant, playful, and elegant interior, coupled with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the outdoor garden, creates a picturesque setting for a memorable birthday celebration, topped by attentive and professional service.",

Price was reasonable compared to other similar-category Italian restaurants. The wine menu was concise which is good. Prices start at $18 per glass/$90 per bottle for the Italian reds.

The appetisers and desserts were great, but what really stole the show was the mains. The beef cheek was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the grilled chicken and red snapper were perfectly seasoned. It's honestly difficult to pick a favourite dish, as each was well executed.\n\nWhat truly set this restaurant apart, though, was the service. The staff were incredibly attentive without being intrusive, and brought us extra plates and utensils for sharing, even before we had to ask. A special mention goes to a gentleman from Nepal (I didn‚Äôt catch his name), who made sure we were well taken care of throughout the meal and checked in on us regularly.\n\nWhile it may not be the most accessible spot to get to, it‚Äôs certainly worth the visit.

The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the bearnaise was the best bearnaise I have had in Singapore. However the Branzini was the best dish we had by far. If you cook your own ribeyes, you might be better of trying their other dishes.\n\nThe service was not perfect, we had to top up our own glasses and we had to ask for steak knives after our main dishes were served.

While multiple visits to one spot isn‚Äôt my thing, I make a fine exception for Mondrian. Jungle Ballroom, Christina, been to them and now I tick Bottega off in my list. What a stunning space. Smart design ensures a fluid entrance into the restaurant, which welcomes you after you do your selfies in the stunning lift. No entrance. Just greeted by the expanse of stunning design. Some oxymorons - a pescatarian stepping foot into a butchers restaurant. We were here for a birthday, I burnt with excitement to plant ourselves in a luxe atmosphere. Pescatarian diet is possible in a luxe butcher's stop. We had the apperitvo set - drink with selection of fine cold cuts (not for me), cheese, olives and focaccia. Be sure to get the artichoke tarts - these tiny morsels pack taste bombs. Then calamari is perfectly fried and the spinach with fried egg is such a pleasing sight and the creamed spinach is a scream. We wanted to get seabass crudo but was full. On a sweet note, the birthday tiramisu was on the house, a surprise to me. The entire experience from top-notch ambiance, to food to service, is perfect.

In Korea, it's like a local food court.\n\nI ordered the small fried oyster at No. 22, the chicken rice set (roasted and steamed half and half, with extra meat) at No. 23, and the Power Avocado at No. 29.\n\nThe fried oyster, unlike what you'd find in Korea, was a stir-fried oyster, egg, and meat dish. It's delicious dipped in sauce and should be eaten while it's still hot. It's even better when mixed with the rice that came with the chicken rice.\n\nThe chicken rice set was delicious with the owner's homemade chili sauce. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the bones were removed, making it easy to eat. The broth tasted like chicken broth you'd get at a milmyeon restaurant, and the bok choy was also good. Above all, the owner was cheerful and friendly. The spicy Sri Cha Cha egg stir-fry, which wasn't on the menu, was especially delicious, but it's a shame they don't sell it. It's difficult to grind and grind the sauce myself, so it's hard to offer it on the menu. The food is delicious, so I highly recommend it!\n\nThe Power Avocado is served shaved ice, filling and delicious. This place is famous for their Avocado + Banana Mix (No. 2), but I couldn't eat it that day because they didn't have any bananas.\n\nAside from that, Rojak (No. 19) has its own distinct flavor profile, but I found it quite enjoyable. The peanuts, sauce, and other ingredients all contributed to the flavors. I enjoyed the pineapple and cucumber inside, but the wheat bread didn't quite suit me. I think it's because the texture was a bit dry. Still, it's worth it.\n\nFinally, the ginger milk tea was delicious and warm.\n\nThere are more locals than tourists here, and there are also police officers and high school students, so I guess that's why the prices are relatively affordable and the food is delicious. After ordering and paying, you can pick up your food when it's your turn. After you're done, you can return it to the non-hala (tray) in the center. A separate staff member will clear your table. It's an open space with fans, so it can be a bit hot, but it's a fun place to enjoy a local atmosphere. Parking is available, and the place is clean. There are also clean restrooms.

Alas he's no longer here but with each bite a piece of the many memories we shared is rekindled ü§≤üèª‚òùüèª\n\nA lot has changed at this food centre. The long queues for the two famous nasi lemak are no longer so evident. The first with the relatively unfriendly makcik stayed the same but the overhyped one that spawned Crave sadly allowed commercialism to spiral their own brand of nasi lemak into expensive blahness. Notably the (in)famous headband auntie with her stupendous famous Mee Soto with the delicious soup is long gone with her. We started not having friendly interaction for she was garang and uncommunicative but we ended up exchanging good tidings when my wife and I bid her well as she battled cancer when we met her in a wheelchair. She left not only with her quietly supportive kind husband who also passed but along with their memorable signature Mee Soto which I used to have with chicken feet and gizzard with the kick of her special chilli sauce.\n\nLuckily this old skool style thick gravy Mee Rebus is continued by the friendly and sweet adik helper taking over from the Pak Haji who used to tend to the stall.\n\nSo with each bite I'm allowing the flood of memories to just bring back to the good old times here.",

This time around, I did not go for the Adam Road Nasi Lemak, nor the Adam Chicken rice as it was not opened. Will come back to try any other time!",

    "text": "TEH HALIYAH MEETS CARROT CAKE\n\nAdam‚Äôs food centre is home to many famous stalls in the island. Well known for Nasi Lemak, Indian Rojak and Mutton Soup, it is a relatively small food centre with a semi open-air, Hexagonal arrangement right beside the Adam‚Äôs flyover.\n\nThe Hawker centre is emotionally attached to me since my first visit in 2014. Whenever I step into this area, along with nostalgia, I look for two items: a bottle of chilled beer from aunty‚Äôs stall and a $5 dark (Singaporean) Carrot Cake with chilli. I am surprised that not many people have mentioned the stall in their super list of Chai Tow Kway, but if I were to make one, this stall would top the list. But the two are closely followed by Teh Haliyah served by the Ronaldinho look-alike Malaysian Indian hawker. This time, I chose the ginger tea over Beer, simply to try a new combination.\n\nWe rarely get a proper visual access to the wok where the chopstick licking Carrot Cake gets done. But the orders are taken with all possible customizations. After a short wait, you could claim your piping hot carrot cake served in a leaf shaped green plate. I strongly recommend that you take no additives like chilli or sauce, but grab a plastic spoon to scrape out the tastiest final remains of sauce from the plate.\n\nOn the other side, it make no sense to watch Ronaldinho making Teh Haliyah. It happens in a time shorter than your brain would take process it. He quickly fills the Teh glass with black tea and strong ginger water and then performs a ‚Äúscoop - throw‚Äù trick to transfer condensed milk from tin to glass. At this stage, most of the tea makers just give it a quick stir and serve. This guy adds tarik (a pull technique) to it to give you a 007 level ‚ÄúShaken, not stirred‚Äù mix.\n\nThe ingredients in the two dishes complement each other perfectly that makes one  plug into nirvana. Fried garlic in the carrot cake combines with the ginger water to strike  the roots of our taste buds while caramelized sugar neutralises the bitter tea to add a new flavour to the milk. Its less likely that you won‚Äôt slurp the carrot cake and finish off the tea in minutes. And beware, you may feel warm and even sweat after the treat. So it is better to sit under the fan for a while, before you decide to leave.",

It was very bright and airy on a weekend morning, , with various types of set ups. You like normal table and chairs? You can sit on those. You like counter type seats? They have you sorted out too. Bar stools and tables? Yup, they have those? Sofa seats? Scoot right in. You have kids? High chairs, children's cutlery and even children's books are available to save the helpless parent. Best of all, power plugs are also pretty much everywhere, so feel free to use your laptop over food and drinks to get some work in.\n\nLastly, while service wasn't particularly exceptional, I got everything I needed without being intruded upon, as all kinds of utensils and necessities are available right at the counter, and everyone was chill about my toddler walking and climbing and blabbering throughout my patronage.\n\nWould definitely go again if I'm in the area.",

I ordered the entr√©e, A Barramundi's Voyage, and the dessert, Sweet Dreams Made In Thai.\n\nA Barramundi's Voyage has great taste with the spicy coconut broth. Tangy and savory with a hint of spiciness make the dish not feel as 'heavy' as it seems. The portion was fairly good. The protein was not dry or tough. I'm not really a fan of fish, but this dish has proved to me that fish can be as good as beef! :)\n\nThe mushrooms and potato leaves, together with the fish and broth, make a great combination of texture and flavor in your mouth. Honestly, I wished the dish was endless.\n\nThe dessert, Sweet Dreams Made In Thai, has a strong tropical flavor with bits of chopped mangoes on top. There was a slight citrus taste to the mango mousse, which made it really refreshing and light.\n\nThe mango mousse may have overpowered the taste of the coconut cream, but nonetheless, the cream together with the mousse was great. The cake was surprisingly not dry as it was sandwiched between the mousse. On top of that, the brown rice puff enhanced the overall texture and feel of the dessert.\n\nWas really glad that I tried it and will definitely recommend this seasonal menu to anyone's visiting!",

One of the best delicacies here is the Nasi Lemak. I choose the Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak stall because it highly rated on Google, and also it has long queue of locals. A complete meal cost only SGD 6.00, which pretty affordable for Singaporean standard. It tastes great with rich flavor on the rice and the chicken. Their sambal was not spicy, but rather going to the sweet side. Overall, an enjoyable experience for me.",

The chicken was crispy and tender and not overly dry just the way I think all Ayam Penyet should be. The chilli was also pretty spicy and I actually couldn't finish all of it.

The outdoor patio is large and offered (new to me!) Two patio options: tables and couches. The tables were served by waitstaff and the couches were \"self serve\" where you scanned a QR code and then used an app to open a tab and order at will! We opted for the couch option post game to let the traffic clear out and to take advantage of the beautiful evening on the patio.\n\nLoved the self service outdoor couch option! The seats were comfy and outside (a plus) and being able to have everyone run their own tabs with the QR code, chose what they wanted, pay when they wanted was a huge hit! Never had that as a dining option before! Very cool.\n\nI hope to get a peak inside the restaurant soon but the large, comfortable patio was perfect on a breezy but hot DC night after the Nats game.\n\nThe food was excellent and the drinks on point.\n\nWill definitely be coming to the \"back side\" of Nats Park more often!",

Maybe 3 weeks after its grand opening, I paid a visit to this location and I vowed to never return. When 1st entering the store, I was not welcomed by any type of greeting. The girl at the register pretty much stared at me while I was deciding on what to order as if I was holding her up.\n\nWhen inquiring about the Hot and Ready pizzas, I asked how long the pizzas had been sitting out and she said they had just come out the oven. I also asked about the crazy bread and she said the same thing. So I placed my order, received my food and it was very luke warm. I politely asked her if they could make a fresh pizza and set of breadsticks for me and she said , \"These ARE fresh\" with the biggest attitude. So we went back and forth a little bit and eventually she asked the cook to make a fresh order, accompanied by an eye roll. When I got my food, it was the sloppiest thing I had ever seen in life.\n\nI then asked her for a refund and she said a manager needed to be there in order for this to happen. I asked her to call the manager if he/she was not there and she claimed they weren't answering the phone. Long story short, I tried calling the store the next day, no response. Then I called district and got a callback right away with refund info and a free pizza offer. I declined the free pizza offer and assured them that I would never return to this particular location again.",

This is after waiting 25 minutes for our appointments! i have health insurance but, was denied service if i didn't agree to pay $40! That's like my doctor refusing to examine me if I don't pay a thermo-body scan! The rationale provided to me was that due to an extended length of time between visits due to COVID, the company made it a requirement! That's ludicrous! We only visit once a year anyway so that doesn't make sense! i don't even wear glasses. Why would I pay for a fancy test! Sounds to me like a business just trying to recoup funds during a pandemic. Sooo disappointed! This place is near my home & now I have to find somewhere else. I will also report them because I don't believe it's legal to deny someone with insurance service because they won't pay for an additional & completely unnecessary test!",

As for appetizers, the crudo was very well-seasoned and balanced. The head cheese also had a great depth of flavor without being overly rich. The entrees were unfortunately where all the misses showed (though I'm aware we only sampled a portion of their menu). There was nothing memorable about the seafood gumbo.

I took one bite and packed the rest to go.\n\nDrinks: The manager very confidently claimed that the State Street Cocktail was so good, we wouldn't be able to order just one. I took a sip of my friend's and it was overly sweet, so I was perfectly content with stopping there. I myself had ordered the Sazerac and it was good but once again, nothing special.",

Someone on their end needs to verify it in real-time, including calling a friend or family member just to verify that you indeed exist and are renting a truck. Unsure how this is a real security measure but regardless.\n\nThen they gave me the lockbox code to get the truck keys, but the app was so clunky that that page disappeared before I could read it. So I promptly spent the next 20 minutes in the pouring rain on hold with their customer service line, just to get the damn lockbox code.

    "text": "\"Not bad.\"\n\nThat's the overall sentiment after dining at Dauphine's.\n\nIt's an impressively sized space where you're likely to never feel overwhelmed, by anything.\n\nWe started out with signature drinks recommended by the waiter. While they were tasty, and clearly concocted with the right amount of creativity and effort... Neither $14 drink left much of an impression. We also started out with two of their top apps. The blue crab fingers and the peel & eat shrimp. While the shrimp lacked any effort of deveining, I found them to be a decent size and quite tasty with the house cocktail sauce. However, the crab fingers were the biggest disappointment of the night. Not only did the heavy cole-sawish composition taste lack any flavor, the tiny dish also came with a few hard shells sprinkled in the mix.. Which made me take a cautious style of eating.\n\nThe entrees were... Good.. You know, not bad. We had the pork belly and steak big plates. Again, both dishes were recommended as two flavorful choices. But neither delivered on that promise.\n\nHaving had almost all different types (as far as preparation) of pork belly... I can say without a shadow of a doubt... That was the least enjoyable one I've ever had. It's texture was that of a pork chop and each bite had to be paired with the collard greens for me to even want to finish. But I was starving... So it didn't take much.\n\nThe steak was.. Again.. Good, but nothing to write home (or Google) about. I felt that I could have made a better one at home.. With a bit of prep. I/we did like the mashed potato balls that came with it. They were probably the best thing about the entire meal.\n\nOh... And we did order two more drinks. One red glass of wine (for the steak) and their proudly promoted Sezrac. The Sezrac was good... Actually.. Better than good.. It was memorable.\n\nOverall, I would give this place another shot... But I don't see it being a 'destination.' I give this place a 6.5 (a Not Bad rating)",

Once at the table, masks can come off, and physical menus are provided (food and drinks). We actually didn't have a reservation, and they seated us outside right away. The well trimmed shrubs created a nice sense of privacy, while not being weird. Our server was EXCELLENT. I have seen some discussion about service in other reviews, but we had an amazing experience. Very attentive, went over everything on the menu (food & drinks) as well as made recommendations (only upon our request). She spoke openly about the Chef, his background, and how the menu reflects his tastes and creativity. Our drinks came out pretty quickly, and the food came out in phases to not crowd our table. We really enjoyed the duck pastrami, the fish pochi, as well as the green pea dip with sesame crisps. We stayed for upwards of 2.5 hours and they never once rushed us or made us feel like we had to leave. While we can recognize there is a slightly higher price tag that some other places close by, there is a special attention paid to details, both in the dishes and the drinks. Definitely recommend giving this place a try, they have come back from their restrictions and the slowdown from the Pandemic shutdown. Give it a chance, I think you could really enjoy yourself.",

The Smores dessert was primarily some type of graham cracker cake with chocolate mixed in parts of it and some marshmallows.  Like all of the food, it looked good, but the taste was just never there.  Service wasn't the best- you order with the phone and they bring your food to you.  Some of it came pretty quick.  The appetizer came before our drinks.  Our dessert took 30 minutes.  My wife asked for extra cherries with her old fashioned and got 2.  She asked for more, and didn't get any.

I got my nails done by someone who seems to be a co-owner of the place and I liked how honest she was with me about running a business. She was super friendly the whole time and I enjoyed talking to her, and she was a real professional with my nails as well. The salon is kept very clean.\n\nI thought my gel manicure turned out fine, but because it didn't turn out as well as she would have liked it to she comped to my entire manicure!

I'm a controls engineer and pretty sure Amazon is simple recording everything in store then having a human review and tally purchases.  I doubt Amazon is doing this fully autonomously when human labor is so cheap.\n\nSome things that are annoying:\n\n1. Only a single small sign that tells you the one tiny button to hit in the Amazon app to display a QR code to gain entry\n\n2. Store was about 50% empty. Most of the produce was gone and many empty shelves\n\n3. Only name brand junk food.\n\n4. Small selection of produce\n\n5. Alcohol section is lacking\n\n6. Prices are a little higher than other locations\n\n7. Amazon doesn't give you a reciept or charge immediately. This further supports my idea that the store is simply reviewing purchases after the fact. Since there's no reciept, and I didn't record the prices for what I purchased there's no way to know if the charge will be accurate. Amazon can increase prices and there's no way to know unless you're prepared.\n\nBasically this is a worse version of any convience store. Lack of selection, lack of prepared foods, no idea of the charges.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, go to a 7/11, CVS, gas station etc. If you are hungry go to a real grocery store.\n\nIf you want to give Bezos more money to continue to exploit employees and waste it on sub orbital flights with a poorly designed rocket, then go to Amazon Fresh",

Tyler was kind to say that I can stay at the hospital and get the car back as soon as the emergency was settled. If you have ever had a number of things go wrong at once and someone makes one of those things better, it means the world.\nI read some of the other reviews here, for example, when people have to wait for the reps at the desk, yes that can be frustrating. But the reps take you down the elevator to the garage and help you find your rental.  Its is a large hotel location, it can take time.  My rental has smelled a little of smoke in the past, I just rolled the window down for 10 minutes and it was fine.  I do not smoke but we live in DC and I am not sure how the reps would prevent people from smoking in the cars while using them.\nI have paid extra in rental just to rent at this location because the reps are very nice, the cars are consistently in great shape and the location is near Dupont metro (for heading to and from the rental), I recommend this Hertz.",

I was out of town over the weekend and got an email LATE SUNDAY that the apartments in the basement started flooding ON SATURDAY (15 hours before). I don‚Äôt know why Bernstein chose not to contact residents when the flooding started, since DC is the ultimate commuter city and most people leave the city on the weekend (not to mention it was August and people go on vacation). I rushed home to find that my apartment had been torn apart because some poor maintenance person had to move all of my stuff out of the water. I understand that sometimes flooding happens, but for the love of God you NEED TO TELL THE RESIDENTS OF YOUR BUILDING WHEN THE FLOODING STARTS. Also, in the days after the flooding Bernstein did not inform residents of when maintenance workers would be coming in, how long machinery would be in our apartments, and when they were relocating us to do renovations.\n\nPositives: Located really close to the Potomac Avenue metro, near Harris Teeter, parking on site even though it's expensive, never had any problems with noise, I am a fan of people having to rent out the roof because prior to that policy people were sleeping and partying up there every night and it was gross\n\nNegatives: Maintenance and office requests go unanswered, the gym equipment is sparse, if you live in the basement you will not have cell reception, the place is like living in a hotel because they do not allow residents to have wreaths on their doors, the apartments were made cheaply (I have electrical outlets that do not work, when maintenance eventually came they told me the outlets were not even hooked up to any internal wiring)",

The finance team there was great to work with, they took care of contacting my insurance and I was charged as accorded.

The spinach provided a nice flavor to the dish.\n\nButter Chicken - it was a good dish, not necessarily what you would expect for the traditional butter chicken. But it had enough flavors to be a good dish.\n\nThe accompanying channa dish with the rice was a good version that satisfy all types of palates.\n\nDefinitely a good place for Indian food and we should be back soon for more of their food!",

Not only that, the braids were so heavy and pulling that I couldn't put the braids in a bun! It was my first time getting knotless and there was no mirror to see what the braider was doing. When I used my front facing camera to look, the braider didn't like that. Should've been a red flag.\n\nWhen I called the owner to discuss what happened, she said they have a policy that they do not refund at all and that she could fix it. How would she fix an entire head of braids installed wrong? Who has 7+ more hours to dedicate to this? She wouldn't even give me a partial refund. Bad business and I was hoping a place in the neighborhood was good.\n\nI took the braids out two days after getting them done (!) and it confirmed they weren't knotless.

I couldn't just leave this baby there to become food for area stray cats looking for a quick snack so I ran into my house for a small box and some paper towels so that I could vet him safely into the box; once he was secure i googled \"wild bird\" rescue in NW, DC which is how I'd found these kind folks. When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches. All's well that ends well! Im so grateful for these small organizations and\nI will be donating to them during our2018 Fall CFC campaign drive! Keep up the good deeds!",
