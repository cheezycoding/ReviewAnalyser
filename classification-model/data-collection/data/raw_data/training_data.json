My favourites would be the smoked quail eggs, followed by the steak frites, then the berry tart. However, everything was well done. Except for the leeks with hazelnuts perhaps, wasnt much of a fan of that as it was a buttery dish and it wasnt served that hot. Having said that, the experience was fun and worth it. I enjoyed savouring each dish, the lovely ambience in the restaurant (there is a 2 hour max seating time, but there are outdoor seats if you feel like exceeding), and the friendly service. It was roughly 200+ per person if you order one drink. I also have chicken allergy and they gladly replaced one of my set menu dishes with a lamb one. The whole menu was quite filling. The tenderloin was amazing - melts in your mouth!",
