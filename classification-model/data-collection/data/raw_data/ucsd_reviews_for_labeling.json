Somehow we connected the past with the future in his design with lots of wood and glass letting in the natural light.\n\nIf you're not a designer or a photographer, here are other reasons to come here:\n\n1) It's clean.\n\n2) Staff are friendly and attentive without being overbearing.\n\n3) They have a large kid section with two play areas.\n\n4) They have private study rooms and conference rooms you can rent for free.\n\n5) There's a playground next door and park.\n\nThis library may be the very best in DC!",

It was a decent experience, but we won't be back.\n\nThe atmosphere is like most fast casual restaurants with plenty of seating. You can build your own kabob or you can order one they make for you. I had the chicken kabob and it was okay. It has french fries inside, but it lacked significant flavor. Same goes for my baklava ($1.50 for a TINY piece). My buddy got the shawarma, which lacked flavor. He had to order an extra dip to give it some taste to it.\n\nAll in all it wasn't the worst experience, but we won't be back.",

The outdoor patio is large and offered (new to me!) Two patio options: tables and couches. The tables were served by waitstaff and the couches were \"self serve\" where you scanned a QR code and then used an app to open a tab and order at will! We opted for the couch option post game to let the traffic clear out and to take advantage of the beautiful evening on the patio.\n\nLoved the self service outdoor couch option! The seats were comfy and outside (a plus) and being able to have everyone run their own tabs with the QR code, chose what they wanted, pay when they wanted was a huge hit! Never had that as a dining option before! Very cool.\n\nI hope to get a peak inside the restaurant soon but the large, comfortable patio was perfect on a breezy but hot DC night after the Nats game.\n\nThe food was excellent and the drinks on point.\n\nWill definitely be coming to the \"back side\" of Nats Park more often!",

Elena, I believe is her name, was SO helpful.  She contacted me when she couldn't find my vision insurance and followed up with me thoroughly up until my appointment just to let me know she was still looking into it and she was doing everything she could to make sure they located my insurance.  I took a wrong turn getting off the metro and was late to my appointment, but when I arrived, they were VERY kind and accommodated me.  Every single employee there greeted me, asked how I was doing, and made friendly conversation as I waited for different aspects of my appointment. The optometrist was great and knowledgeable. I received my lenses in the allotted time-frame they gave me and I also got complimentary sunglasses. I have NO CLUE why anyone would have a negative experience here.  It is some of the best customer service I have ever received in a medical office.",

My sister, a buddy from college, and myself decided to finally try this place on 1/27/2021. Centrolina did not disappoint, our server Tim was extremely friendly and made us feel like we owned the place. In addition, the hostess was equally attentive to us as well. The seating respects DC guidelines for social distancing and the staff wears masks and gloves. We basically had the entire one side to ourselves. LETS TALK FOOD! The below pictures are just that pictures. The swordfish me and my buddy had was extremely flaky and melted in your mouth. My sisters pasta was also really good, never ever had I had a white bolognese sauce before and that didn‚Äôt disappoint. My favorite little snack of the meal was the little triangles on the one plate. You could eat those little triangles all day! All and alll I would definitely come back to this again.

I mean the majority are so very rude and nasty. On my third visit to get my license, I was told that the name on my information was not my name. I asked for the manager, a woman who was just as nasty. I was in tears by now. Each time I was told something different. Finally, a man who I guess was their supervisor approached and reviewed my information, asked to see my bank statement, then sent me to another person to give my information to and be photographed. It is a horror there. I really hate to have to go there. I would give them zero if I could.",

    "text": "OMG...The worst customer service experience ever! Being from the Midwest, I was SO excited to learn that a new Little Caesars was coming to NW DC. Maybe 3 weeks after its grand opening, I paid a visit to this location and I vowed to never return. When 1st entering the store, I was not welcomed by any type of greeting. The girl at the register pretty much stared at me while I was deciding on what to order as if I was holding her up.\n\nWhen inquiring about the Hot and Ready pizzas, I asked how long the pizzas had been sitting out and she said they had just come out the oven. I also asked about the crazy bread and she said the same thing. So I placed my order, received my food and it was very luke warm. I politely asked her if they could make a fresh pizza and set of breadsticks for me and she said , \"These ARE fresh\" with the biggest attitude. So we went back and forth a little bit and eventually she asked the cook to make a fresh order, accompanied by an eye roll. When I got my food, it was the sloppiest thing I had ever seen in life.\n\nI then asked her for a refund and she said a manager needed to be there in order for this to happen. I asked her to call the manager if he/she was not there and she claimed they weren't answering the phone. Long story short, I tried calling the store the next day, no response. Then I called district and got a callback right away with refund info and a free pizza offer. I declined the free pizza offer and assured them that I would never return to this particular location again.",

Today that all changed when we showed up for our appointments and were told it was MANDATORY for us to take some specialized test that was on sale for $19.99 to even receive an eye exam. This is after waiting 25 minutes for our appointments! i have health insurance but, was denied service if i didn't agree to pay $40! That's like my doctor refusing to examine me if I don't pay a thermo-body scan! The rationale provided to me was that due to an extended length of time between visits due to COVID, the company made it a requirement! That's ludicrous! We only visit once a year anyway so that doesn't make sense! i don't even wear glasses. Why would I pay for a fancy test! Sounds to me like a business just trying to recoup funds during a pandemic. Sooo disappointed! This place is near my home & now I have to find somewhere else. I will also report them because I don't believe it's legal to deny someone with insurance service because they won't pay for an additional & completely unnecessary test!",

This style was not worth $40. Let me find the other pic so you can see what the stylist did that I had her take out. You didn't even have the color hair I preferred. Lol thanks for your response tho. Oh and did I mention you. Or whoever the owner is was rude as hell when she arrived. I won't  be back.. Nice welcoming!",

I very much have enjoyed my time at CTC so far - I've had the opportunity to meet a diverse, accomplished group of members and received a warm welcome from the membership.  The club offers varied activities, ranging from interesting book talks and lectures to more social events like wine tastings and seasonal parties.  The food and wine selection is fabulous.  The building itself, c. 1796, is extremely well maintained and well-appointed with beautiful furniture and decoration on its seemingly endless floors.  The club is a lovely place to host your next get together or party and can handle events of all sizes and types.  Heather and staff are the stars of the show, creating beautiful events that run the gamut.  I'm thrilled to have found my home away from home in Georgetown.",

I decided that I would get the sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin. They show it on the board and says the price is $4.05. I get no cheese as shown in the pictures and they charge me $4.55, I guess even though they show the item with a picture on an English muffin, they want to screw you for an extra 50 cents. The sausage is bland, the muffin soggy because it wasn't toasted. First time here, last time here.",

Our meal started off with the bread board, which was a definite hit--the biscuit bites were perfectly flaky and buttery, the sweet potato brioche pillowy, and the baguette the right amount of crustiness and chewiness. As for appetizers, the crudo was very well-seasoned and balanced. The head cheese also had a great depth of flavor without being overly rich. The entrees were unfortunately where all the misses showed (though I'm aware we only sampled a portion of their menu). There was nothing memorable about the seafood gumbo. And similarly, the po' boy was just meh. I took one bite and packed the rest to go.\n\nDrinks: The manager very confidently claimed that the State Street Cocktail was so good, we wouldn't be able to order just one. I took a sip of my friend's and it was overly sweet, so I was perfectly content with stopping there. I myself had ordered the Sazerac and it was good but once again, nothing special.",

They looked at me like I was an idiot and again stated it was because it was due to all the fixings I ordered with it. To me this says they‚Äôre incapable of finding a good ratio of food and or have never folded a burrito before. Which if they‚Äôre providing this as an option They should get proper training. I pushed for something else and they suggested the same thing but as a quesadilla.  I got back almost the same results. The girl could barely fold the tortilla in half and cook it properly.

Once I arrived at 745, I went to the wrong office (multiple offices in the building) on the first floor and was directed upstairs by a friendly associate. I was seen only 10 minutes behind schedule, as the office seemed pretty busy for early morning.\n\nThe staff who prepped me in office for the exam was wonderful, had great communication skills and put me at ease before the scan. Only had to wait a few minutes between going back and the scan itself. Staff made me feel comfortable, even giving me a blanket during the process. For something that can be nerve wracking, they made the experience as smooth and as comfortable as possible.",

The app is extremely clunky and regularly doesn't register your clicks to allow you onto the next page.\n\nYou need to submit all kinds of info upon arrival, not before, so prepare for a lengthy delay at pickup time despite the fact that they could've just had you submit everything earlier. Someone on their end needs to verify it in real-time, including calling a friend or family member just to verify that you indeed exist and are renting a truck. Unsure how this is a real security measure but regardless.\n\nThen they gave me the lockbox code to get the truck keys, but the app was so clunky that that page disappeared before I could read it. So I promptly spent the next 20 minutes in the pouring rain on hold with their customer service line, just to get the damn lockbox code. The app thought I'd already started driving, so my only option there was to request roadside assistance (dysfunctional app wouldn't let me submit a request for that either).\n\nAdd it all up and you've got a terrible user experience.

    "text": "\"Not bad.\"\n\nThat's the overall sentiment after dining at Dauphine's.\n\nIt's an impressively sized space where you're likely to never feel overwhelmed, by anything.\n\nWe started out with signature drinks recommended by the waiter. While they were tasty, and clearly concocted with the right amount of creativity and effort... Neither $14 drink left much of an impression. We also started out with two of their top apps. The blue crab fingers and the peel & eat shrimp. While the shrimp lacked any effort of deveining, I found them to be a decent size and quite tasty with the house cocktail sauce. However, the crab fingers were the biggest disappointment of the night. Not only did the heavy cole-sawish composition taste lack any flavor, the tiny dish also came with a few hard shells sprinkled in the mix.. Which made me take a cautious style of eating.\n\nThe entrees were... Good.. You know, not bad. We had the pork belly and steak big plates. Again, both dishes were recommended as two flavorful choices. But neither delivered on that promise.\n\nHaving had almost all different types (as far as preparation) of pork belly... I can say without a shadow of a doubt... That was the least enjoyable one I've ever had. It's texture was that of a pork chop and each bite had to be paired with the collard greens for me to even want to finish. But I was starving... So it didn't take much.\n\nThe steak was.. Again.. Good, but nothing to write home (or Google) about. I felt that I could have made a better one at home.. With a bit of prep. I/we did like the mashed potato balls that came with it. They were probably the best thing about the entire meal.\n\nOh... And we did order two more drinks. One red glass of wine (for the steak) and their proudly promoted Sezrac. The Sezrac was good... Actually.. Better than good.. It was memorable.\n\nOverall, I would give this place another shot... But I don't see it being a 'destination.' I give this place a 6.5 (a Not Bad rating)",

Once at the table, masks can come off, and physical menus are provided (food and drinks). We actually didn't have a reservation, and they seated us outside right away. The well trimmed shrubs created a nice sense of privacy, while not being weird. Our server was EXCELLENT. I have seen some discussion about service in other reviews, but we had an amazing experience. Very attentive, went over everything on the menu (food & drinks) as well as made recommendations (only upon our request). She spoke openly about the Chef, his background, and how the menu reflects his tastes and creativity. Our drinks came out pretty quickly, and the food came out in phases to not crowd our table. We really enjoyed the duck pastrami, the fish pochi, as well as the green pea dip with sesame crisps. We stayed for upwards of 2.5 hours and they never once rushed us or made us feel like we had to leave. While we can recognize there is a slightly higher price tag that some other places close by, there is a special attention paid to details, both in the dishes and the drinks. Definitely recommend giving this place a try, they have come back from their restrictions and the slowdown from the Pandemic shutdown. Give it a chance, I think you could really enjoy yourself.",

The cornbread was decent- my wife didn't eat it because it was a little dry.  The strip steak was very chewy and just didn't have much flavor.  I know what strip steak is, but it just wasn't good.  The Smores dessert was primarily some type of graham cracker cake with chocolate mixed in parts of it and some marshmallows.  Like all of the food, it looked good, but the taste was just never there.  Service wasn't the best- you order with the phone and they bring your food to you.  Some of it came pretty quick.  The appetizer came before our drinks.  Our dessert took 30 minutes.  My wife asked for extra cherries with her old fashioned and got 2.  She asked for more, and didn't get any.  She asked again, and got a few more about 5 minutes later.  The place is nice, the outdoor seating is great, but we just weren't impressed with the food.",

I get to the store and she rings my oder up and tells me it's now $27 and change. I'm like \"that's not what t was listed online and what's the problem\"? She tells me there's tax and I'm saying \"Not $12 or more in tax\"! Then she says ,\"well that's the online special and you called the order in\". I'm now explaining I've called in orders before and that's never been a problem, then she goes on to say \"well our policy has changed\" ! So a few more seconds of conversation goes nowhere and now I'm angry AND hungry so I  pay for the pizzas and leave.  Papa John's has just lost another customer an now get home to find out there's little bacon on my chicken  and bacon pizza. All in all a frustrating and disappointing experience!",

I'm a controls engineer and pretty sure Amazon is simple recording everything in store then having a human review and tally purchases.  I doubt Amazon is doing this fully autonomously when human labor is so cheap.\n\nSome things that are annoying:\n\n1. Only a single small sign that tells you the one tiny button to hit in the Amazon app to display a QR code to gain entry\n\n2. Store was about 50% empty. Most of the produce was gone and many empty shelves\n\n3. Only name brand junk food.\n\n4. Small selection of produce\n\n5. Alcohol section is lacking\n\n6. Prices are a little higher than other locations\n\n7. Amazon doesn't give you a reciept or charge immediately. This further supports my idea that the store is simply reviewing purchases after the fact. Since there's no reciept, and I didn't record the prices for what I purchased there's no way to know if the charge will be accurate. Amazon can increase prices and there's no way to know unless you're prepared.\n\nBasically this is a worse version of any convience store. Lack of selection, lack of prepared foods, no idea of the charges.\n\nIf you're in a hurry, go to a 7/11, CVS, gas station etc. If you are hungry go to a real grocery store.\n\nIf you want to give Bezos more money to continue to exploit employees and waste it on sub orbital flights with a poorly designed rocket, then go to Amazon Fresh",

I've had many of the standards and they've all been good, my last order however I decided to try Chow Mein for the very first time it was AWESOME, j don't know if this is indictive of the fish though since I've never bothered to order it anywhere else. I usually stick to the Szechuan dishes, but I've had many of the other offerings and liked them as well. The Wonton soup is good, not the best and I've had the egg drop soup, but again it was my first order of it and it was nice, not my cup of tea. This is how I feel about the dishes at any asian place I've been to and tried like hot garlic sauce dishes, I've had it at many places in DC and I just don't like it, but Szechuan house at least has the garlic I can see and the vegetables and meat are fresh.

Tyler was kind to say that I can stay at the hospital and get the car back as soon as the emergency was settled. If you have ever had a number of things go wrong at once and someone makes one of those things better, it means the world.\nI read some of the other reviews here, for example, when people have to wait for the reps at the desk, yes that can be frustrating. But the reps take you down the elevator to the garage and help you find your rental.  Its is a large hotel location, it can take time.  My rental has smelled a little of smoke in the past, I just rolled the window down for 10 minutes and it was fine.  I do not smoke but we live in DC and I am not sure how the reps would prevent people from smoking in the cars while using them.\nI have paid extra in rental just to rent at this location because the reps are very nice, the cars are consistently in great shape and the location is near Dupont metro (for heading to and from the rental), I recommend this Hertz.",

I was out of town over the weekend and got an email LATE SUNDAY that the apartments in the basement started flooding ON SATURDAY (15 hours before). I don‚Äôt know why Bernstein chose not to contact residents when the flooding started, since DC is the ultimate commuter city and most people leave the city on the weekend (not to mention it was August and people go on vacation). I rushed home to find that my apartment had been torn apart because some poor maintenance person had to move all of my stuff out of the water. I understand that sometimes flooding happens, but for the love of God you NEED TO TELL THE RESIDENTS OF YOUR BUILDING WHEN THE FLOODING STARTS. Also, in the days after the flooding Bernstein did not inform residents of when maintenance workers would be coming in, how long machinery would be in our apartments, and when they were relocating us to do renovations.\n\nPositives: Located really close to the Potomac Avenue metro, near Harris Teeter, parking on site even though it's expensive, never had any problems with noise, I am a fan of people having to rent out the roof because prior to that policy people were sleeping and partying up there every night and it was gross\n\nNegatives: Maintenance and office requests go unanswered, the gym equipment is sparse, if you live in the basement you will not have cell reception, the place is like living in a hotel because they do not allow residents to have wreaths on their doors, the apartments were made cheaply (I have electrical outlets that do not work, when maintenance eventually came they told me the outlets were not even hooked up to any internal wiring)",

During the day of the surgery everything went accordantly, surgery went smooth, duration was around 1 hr, surprisingly I came out without any significant swelling and no pain and was able to return to work the following day. The finance team there was great to work with, they took care of contacting my insurance and I was charged as accorded. Just want to give a special thanks to Dr. Park and his team for taking really good care of me that day, you are all awesome! Would highly recommend to anyone in the area.",

This restaurant had been on our list for a while ever since we got to try food from this restaurant at our friends'.\n\nThe location is convenient though you have to look for the entrance next to the other businesses.\n\nWe tried the following dishes:\nChicken Biryani  - this was a good dish - rice was cooked well and the chicken was tender and flavorful.\n\nSaag Chicken - this was a good dish and had a kick to it too. The spinach provided a nice flavor to the dish.\n\nButter Chicken - it was a good dish, not necessarily what you would expect for the traditional butter chicken. But it had enough flavors to be a good dish.\n\nThe accompanying channa dish with the rice was a good version that satisfy all types of palates.\n\nDefinitely a good place for Indian food and we should be back soon for more of their food!",

My entire service took about 7 hours - and while the braids were neat, I quickly realized that they actually weren't knotless - the braider still used a thin knot of hair at the root. Not only that, the braids were so heavy and pulling that I couldn't put the braids in a bun! It was my first time getting knotless and there was no mirror to see what the braider was doing. When I used my front facing camera to look, the braider didn't like that. Should've been a red flag.\n\nWhen I called the owner to discuss what happened, she said they have a policy that they do not refund at all and that she could fix it. How would she fix an entire head of braids installed wrong? Who has 7+ more hours to dedicate to this? She wouldn't even give me a partial refund. Bad business and I was hoping a place in the neighborhood was good.\n\nI took the braids out two days after getting them done (!) and it confirmed they weren't knotless. When I told the owner this she said \"this is how we do knotless.\" So she lied. She was in the shop the entire time my hair was braided and let it happen. Never again!",

I had a tinting of the brow the 24th of December and noticed that the dye was FADING rather quickly, within 4 days the gray hair was back and on the 9ith day following the service I went back to the salon for them to correct.  I expected the correction to  be quick but I found A CALL TO THE OWNER was needed and I was told that if I wanted a correction it SHOULD HAVE BEEN TWO DAYS from the time of a tinting.  TINTING LAST BETWEEN 4to6 WEEKS!!!  I was tinted quickly without  paying for the service again.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BEHAVIOR and WILL RE-THINK using this salon again.  THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT A LOYAL CUSTOMER!",

I couldn't just leave this baby there to become food for area stray cats looking for a quick snack so I ran into my house for a small box and some paper towels so that I could vet him safely into the box; once he was secure i googled \"wild bird\" rescue in NW, DC which is how I'd found these kind folks. When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches. All's well that ends well! Im so grateful for these small organizations and\nI will be donating to them during our2018 Fall CFC campaign drive! Keep up the good deeds!",
