    "review_text": "Stepping into this restaurant immediately sets the tone for a refined yet warmly inviting dining experience. The high ceilings, exposed beams, and striking vertical pillars give the space a grand industrial-chic feel, complemented by warm amber lighting and neatly set tables. The open kitchen allows diners to watch the chefs in action, adding an engaging, lively atmosphere.\n\nThe food presentation is elegant and minimalist, allowing the quality of the ingredients to shine. The slices of beef are cooked to a perfect medium-rare, with a delicate char on the outside and a juicy, tender center, paired simply with fresh greens for a clean, balanced plate. Another standout is the richly glazed beef-topped toast, crowned with tart pickles and fresh chives\u2014a harmonious combination of sweet, tangy, and savory notes.\n\nThe playful touch of charred marshmallows on skewers hints at the restaurant\u2019s creative flair, blending nostalgic comfort with gourmet technique.\n\nService is very attentive and professional, with the chefs clearly passionate about their craft. Overall, this is a place that blends sophisticated dining with a relaxed ambience, making it perfect for both special occasions and indulgent casual meals.",

    "review_text": "Finally after months of waiting, secured a meal in this popular restaurant..\n\nBurnt ends, actually served beyond steak as their signature..but smoked flavours in all their cuisine.\n\nGrissini, crisp breadsticks, paired with taramasalata, a traditional Greek dip made from salted cod roe, olive oil, lemon juice, and crispy flat bread was refreshing great appetising starter.\n\nQuail egg smoked giving an explosive smoky flavour on one bite, caviar was a great compliment to the texture and brings freshness to the smokeness.\n\nJamaica wings or rather a halved wing, looks too small for me, but it took me 3 bites , hahaha. Is because I totally loved that flavour and slowly tasted the wonderful wings flavour.\n\nEel and bone marrow, like the photos shows..seems normal like a unagi sushi , but this is done smoked flavour glazed in the special miso sauce that I consider 5 \ud83c\udf1f against any omakase japanese resturant.   The bone marrow was hidden as a base that did not really over power the eel.\n\nMain course was WA Marron grill to perfection, like medium rare..that is preserved the softness of the body, the glazed sauce was amazing don\u2019t even remember what was it.\n\nFinally the Australian steak, it was ok, lack the punch of a wow for a steak\n\nConcluded with smoked lava cake, this is totally amazingly different with a strong smoky smoke in ur mouth,  of course it has to be eaten with the ice cream.\n\nI am thrilled by the different presentation of course that resembles smoky identity yet letting each element of food be amazingly created to refine texture and taste.",

The food was amazing and the dinner course was well spaced out and fresh. Felt very full and satisfied after. Cocktails are great and we were recommended drinks to pair with our food courses. The steak was the star of the course, perfectly cooked with a delicious smokey char. The service was excellent as well with waitstaff explaining each dish and recommending how to eat each course to fully enjoy them. Definitely work a visit during a special occasion and lives up to its name being one of the top 100 restaurants in the world.",

    "review_text": "After few years of attemp to make a booking to this restaurant, I have emailed the restaurant to find that booking slots open exactly 45 days in advance, at 10am sharp for lunch reservation. Slots are fully booked within a few hours. Tips for those looking to make reservation.\n\nFood wise, what I love:\nBeef cube roll (ribeye steak)\nGrissini,\nBeef and uni\nFennel (root vegetable)\nBeef cube roll is the best steak we have ever had (we have ordered 200g). It was simple yet masterfully done. Right level of tenderness, high quality beef.\nTheir small dishes are surprisingly nice for a steak house. Right balance in flavour, leaving you wanting to come back for more.\n\nFor individuals who prefer food's natural flavour and not too overpowering taste, I would not recommend:\nFlat iron\nMarron (small lobster)\nThese two dishes are too flavourful for me - flavours are too rich that it was hard for me to finish my portion.\nTheir sourdough bread is too hard for me as well, I couldn't chew through the crust and it's hard and chewy. Had better bread elsewhere.\n\nTheir service was excellent! We were served by Tim Chew. He was very patient and detailed in offering food recommendations to us. Very genuine guy who made our visit there very pleasant and memorable. The service crew is generally very nice and attentive to details.\n\nOverall, it is recommended to lower your expectations to this extremely hard to book restaurant, and you will be pleasantly surprised with the dining experience that you may have. As the dishes here varied (from super flavourful/rich to a more balanced taste), it is good to choose your side and let the service crew know such that you can have the recommended dishes accordingly. We couldn't make up our mind hence we tried the whole spectrum.",

We ordered the tasting menu for four. The chef personally came to ask our daughters about their preferences, which made the experience feel very thoughtful.\n\nAs each dish arrived, it was great to see our daughters trying new flavours and enjoying the creative food.\n\nThank you, Brunt Ends! Tonight was a fun and memorable experience for the whole family.\n\nThumbs up for the whole team.",

The space is amazing, intimate, yet still vibey. The service throughout the night was just right\u2014 attentive but not pushy or rushed. My partner had the tasting menu, and I had the bar bites. Every single thing we ate was 10/10, some things 11/10, with some of our favorites being the smoked quail egg, the beef marmalade, the tenderloin, fried drumlet, and the beef empanada. No review would be complete without mentioning the amazing cocktails! My partner did the cocktail pairing with the tasting menu, which was a unique and enjoyable way to experience different flavors to accompany the meal. I tried a few different cocktails, all extremely flavorful, unique, and crafted to perfection. Shout out to Shak, for his craftsmanship! While pricey, the food, drinks, staff, and experience lived up to it all. High end dining at its best. Thank you, Burnt Ends!",

Judging from the photos here, it looks like they used to operate out of a smaller place that looked a lot more casual than what it is today.\n\nWas told that by several people that the starters were not the main attraction here, which was disappointing to me because I'm a huge fan of starters. Going with the majority, we went a bit light on the starters and focused on their steaks.\n\nOverall, I'd say the food was great. The meats were done to perfection, probably one of the better if not best meats I've had in a while. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, and not left for the guests to mess it up themselves.\n\nService felt a wee bit curt, although with a lot of helpful suggestions. Not a huge fan of the ambience (a tad too dim for my liking and the choice of music). Would consider going for the chef's select option if I ever have the chance to revisit.",

Then of course, as you probably know, if you\u2019re looking at this place - the food was amazing. The flavors packed into small bites put this on my map for a much longer, proper sit down next time I\u2019m in Singapore.

While it might be pricey, the overall experience is worth every penny. A truly unforgettable meal!\n\nTip: Be prepared for a wait, but it\u2019s worth it!",

Who would think of putting leek with hazelnuts? But the creativity on the menu is off the charts. And it works. I tried a tasting menu which comprised of most of their favourites. Unfortunately by the end, was already unable to squeeze in anymore meat so we had to leave it at the pulled slider.\nEvery dish was thoughtfully prepared you could tell. Mind u, the food here is meant to be savoury which is right up my alley. Strong tastes and heavy seasoning is used. I love that.\nEndless banter with the wait staff also made for a good evening.\nIf I could even remotely be able to get a table next time, I\u2019d surely be back.",

Food was generally decent but there were hits and misses across the items that we ordered. The flat iron steak, pork, bone marrow, octopus, burnt cheesecake and marshmallow were very well executed and each outstanding in its own.

Squid pasta and mistake mushroom porridge were also wonderful. Grissini was ok only (relative to the other amazing dishes). The warm Sourdough bread was the perfect vehicle to mop everything up.  All the dishes was rich, but without feeling greasy.  Super attentive service. I never had to raise my arms up more than a couple of seconds. Everything was done with such care and attention to detail.  We sat at the chefs table and it was inquisitively entertaining. The chefs and waiters were very happy to answer any questions we had.  The guy next to the furnace had a tough job!  Was slightly worried it would be too smoky indoors with all the indoor bbq cooking, but I needn\u2019t have been. Price is high yes, but a couple of dishes especially the flat iron and the squid we felt was particularly worth it.  Looks like we may have to come back again. Nicely done team!",

Furthermore, I could reserved the bar side, I can say it is the best choice. While having a dinner, I could literally feel the passion of chefs and the enthusiastic atmosphere there.

Each meat was cooked flawlessly, with the inside juicy and tender full of umami flavour. The king crab as garlic brown butter is a MUST!(Tip: ask for a side of sourdough bread to scoop up that delicious sauce with)\n\nIf I could give 10 stars to the service team - Richard, Vincent and others, I would. They went over and above from remembering details of our dietary requirements, perfect-to-the-t food recommendations, to the complimentary anniversary shots and pastries. When my partners pigeon had some texture issues, they didn\u2019t even bring it out, and told us apologetically that they had to redo it. The service recovery was a salt pepper pork that was so heavenly we almost fell off our chairs (this needs to be on the menu!)\n\nThank you for a wonderful night, Burnt Ends. We will be back for sure!",

My favourites would be the smoked quail eggs, followed by the steak frites, then the berry tart. However, everything was well done. Except for the leeks with hazelnuts perhaps, wasnt much of a fan of that as it was a buttery dish and it wasnt served that hot. Having said that, the experience was fun and worth it. I enjoyed savouring each dish, the lovely ambience in the restaurant (there is a 2 hour max seating time, but there are outdoor seats if you feel like exceeding), and the friendly service. It was roughly 200+ per person if you order one drink. I also have chicken allergy and they gladly replaced one of my set menu dishes with a lamb one. The whole menu was quite filling. The tenderloin was amazing - melts in your mouth!",

Initially, attempting to secure a reservation more than a month before our trip proved challenging, as they were fully booked. However, a stroke of luck came our way when a fellow foodie from one of my groups suggested trying a walk-in. Intrigued, we decided to forgo a hosted dinner and give it a shot. To our surprise, we arrived at 6:15 pm, and within 30 minutes, we were comfortably seated at a table - the staff informed us we had until 8:15 pm. It felt like we had won a small lottery, and the anticipation for the evening grew.\n\nThe atmosphere was everything we hoped for - chill, relaxed, and with a front-row seat to the culinary action. We enjoyed watching the chefs expertly grill our dishes, adding to the overall dining experience. The two-hour time frame was more than enough for us, and the feeling of exclusivity made the evening even more special. \ud83e\udd70\n\nAs for the food, it was a symphony of flavors. From the perfectly cooked steak to the delightful cocktails, every dish was a masterpiece. The ambiance, coupled with the superb culinary skills on display, created a dining experience that was truly sublime. Burnt Ends exceeded our expectations, and I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary adventure in Singapore.",

The staff were incredibly attentive and each brought their own personality to the service by offering genuine recommendations from the menu. It was refreshing to see staff genuinely share their thoughts, unlike other places where suggestions can feel a bit rehearsed.\n\nWe went steak-heavy and ordered 250g of the flat iron and 250g of the Blackmores strip loin, both cooked to perfection at medium rare. Each cut was flavorful and perfectly seared, showcasing the quality and skill at Burnt Ends. One highlight was a special off-menu item we tried \u2013 the beef marmalade with house pickles (pictured). I highly recommend it for anyone dining here; it\u2019s an experience all its own.\n\nTo accompany the meal, we shared a bottle of Singaporean craft beer, which paired deliciously with the rich flavors of the steaks.\n\nOverall, Burnt Ends ticks all the boxes for a memorable dining experience. The only downside? Due to its popularity, securing a reservation here takes time, so plan well in advance. Also, keep in mind that this place is definitely on the pricier side, but absolutely worth it.",

Reservations are impossible to make, so big thanks to my bud for helping to secure the slot.\n\nOur counter seats were right in front of Executive Chef Patrick and he took excellent care of us. The night was perfect with fantastic food, a nice bottle of Tignanello (her birth year vintage of 2006 no less) and simply spending time together.\n\nIt was our first time in Burnt Ends so we decided to go with Chef Patrick\u2019s recommendations. The only decision we had to make was the choice of the steak cut, and the 49 days dry aged cut was it. Omg, it was melt-in-your-mouth with outstanding flavors.\n\nThe other standouts for me:\n1. Chicken neck\u2026 freaking amazing taste bomb!\n\n2. Maitake mushroom w congee & egg yolk. It was so so so good with the earthiness and char of the mushroom paired with the creaminess of the congee.\n\n3. The king crab was out of this world and he gave us sourdough to wipe the plate clean, unbelivably good!\n\nWanted to do a wefie with Chef Patrick but he counter offered by taking a proper photo of us, so sweet of him. Thanks again, Chef for making the evening a perfect one for my daughter\u2019s 18th \u2764\ufe0f",

    "review_text": "We had an incredible dining experience at Burnt Ends! After multiple attempts to secure a booking, I finally got lucky. We opted for the \u00e0 la carte menu and ordered the grissini, eggplant miso, lamb koftas, pulled pork sanger, roasted chicken, bone marrow bun, and butterhead lettuce on the side. Every single dish was outstanding. The lamb koftas were bursting with flavour! The chicken was so tasty and not dry like I often find at other restaurants. The service was flawless\u2014the waiters were so attentive throughout the meal. My tip: don\u2019t share the grissini\u2014get one for yourself, it\u2019s that good! I was hesitant about the bone marrow bun at first, but after reading some reviews, I gave it a try, and it was amazing. We ended with the berry tart and roasted marshmallow, and my only regret is that we didn\u2019t each get our own tart, it was absolutely delicious. I can\u2019t wait to come back here next time I\u2019m in Singapore!",

The food, service and atmosphere are all top notch.\n\nStarting with the food, expect dry aged, charcoal grilled prime cuts of some of the worlds best beef and lamb paired with spice filled sauces. Full of rich flavor and umami. The sauces offered helped elevate the flavours to the next level.\n\nThe staff were the perfect balance of friendly, approachable and professional. They were always happy to chat and share about the food and wine provided.\n\nOverall this was definitely a memorable experience and I look forward to my next visit.",

The food really made use of amazing fresh ingredients that are cooked to perfection. The beef steak at the end had a nice char to the crust. The uni on the crab toast was mouth wateringly good. The marmalade beef on toast was also so soft and delicious.\n\nOverall, a superb dinner. The cocktails and wine selection were also amazing, and I highly recommend ordering.",

Grissini & taramasalata - The leeks, hazelnut, and white truffle dish was a very good combination.\n4. Chicken for 2 - The chefs took a while to cook this, and they had a lot of technique. I found the accompanying sauce a bit too sweet for me.\n5. Beef - Dining companion had it. Thumbs up.\n6. Berry Tart - Really good. It looked really simple and home made but very well done. Loved it!\n7. Marshmallow - It was smoky and had a citrus taste to it. Good but you may want to skip this.\n\nTotal bill: 381 for 2 pax.\n\nThere\u2019s alot of action going on when seated at the grill area. Tensions ran high, and alot of respect for the chefs who were putting their heart and sleeve into the food. You may find the grill area a little too warm. Another couple mentioned about the heat repeatedly, and they were shifted away after her third mention.\n\nWe ended off with some lovely doughnuts at the bakery with coffee. Highly recommend.",

It's close to our home but quite a walk to the restaurant. One this Sunday we decided to drive there as she has to attend church afterwards.\n\nThe restaurant live up to it's hype. Waitress, Jo, was very helpful and friendly. Recommendations she made was spot on for us. Rendang Mushroom Burger, Spicy Thai Beef Quesadilla, Awesome Tonic hits the spot. The buns are so soft and fluffy it's simply delicious. The deco are traditional Chinese.. looks \"messy\" but it generates a good vibe. The place is relaxing although it can get crowd quickly.\n\nI'd suggest you make reservations in case you have to wait. It's really worth the visit.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSecond visit last weekend. Tried different things and just as delicious. Their bread are super fluffy. Highly recommended.",

It was a great way to start before transitioning to the alcoholic The Charmer, another frozen treat. Paired with a fun charcuterie board, it made for a delightful, laid-back Sunday afternoon.

Bong picked up the phone and jollily told me that we\u2019re more than welcome to come in.\n\nAfter we sat down, Bong approached us to personally walk us through the menu. Thanks to his recommendation, we tried the Duck Confit Burger. It was SO GOOOOD. The duck almost tasted like shredded beef without feeling overly fatty, and the bun paired with the cheese was to die for.\n\nSafe to say, we won\u2019t wait another 2 years to come back!\n\nSpecial shoutout to Bong for his incredibly cool personality and warm service, and shoutout to Jo for her great service!",

I had heard about this place for quite some time through friends\u2026and on my visit to Singapore from Toronto this time I am really glad I made an impromptu stopover. Was only planning to take a peep as I was on way back from work meetings\u2026but I am really glad that their longtime team member Mandeep Kumar persuaded me to have a drink. Starting with wine\u2026I ended up staying for a delicious meal\u2026\u2026an excellent \u2018awesome salad\u2019\u2026 a fabulous \u2018pineapple upside down cake\u2019\u2026.served warm with coconut  icecream\u2026.and of course a double espresso to top it all. I love my desserts\u2026and the pineapple upside down cake was DELICIOUS!! The restaurant has an AWESOME vibe\u2026great crowd\u2026packed busy even on a weekday\u2026thus clearly very popular. I was sitting alone in a busy restaurant\u2026.but Mandeep Kumar was very kind to make sure I was looked after very well. He certainly did make all the difference in having someone just take a casual peep and walk away\u2026.to instead having a lovely meal and a very enjoyable evening. Certainly plan to visit again. Thank you Mandeep Kumar! I think it certainly makes a difference when restaurants have frontline staff who have also worked in the kitchen as chefs. Hope to see Bong, Frank & Roland next time to congratulate them on establishing My Awesome Cafe.",

But above all, the staff here, Simon and especially Jolynn, were really friendly and their service was just impeccable. Jolynn heard that it\u2019s my birthday and insisted to offer us a slice of cake on the house even though we said we were full (which was really yummy btw!). The food portions here are really generous and good for sharing, which makes it a great place for group gatherings. I can see why this cafe is so popular during lunch time. Will definitely be back soon to try their other mains!",

I got it hot and it was good! There's a bit of grainy matcha on the bottom though.\n\nAvocado toast - they were very generous with their avocado! Highly recommend this dish. It was seasoned very well. Their tomato was a bit mushy for me but it's just a preference.\n\nEspresso soda - it's a sparkly drink. It was citrusy and pretty good. Usually people call or espresso tonic but they have it under soda.",

Honest mistake.\n\nHe was prepared to make another order. However, we check with the staff if there is something that they can support.\n\nEven though it was clearly my friend\u2019s slip-up, the staff went out of his way to replace the drink without hesitation or fuss. It was such a thoughtful gesture, and honestly not something you see every day in busy caf\u00e9s.\n\nThis staff was actually taking care of the cashier and ensuring the whole cafe operation is running well.\n\nFood-wise, everything we had was good. I had this weekend special Halibut fish\u2014fresh, flavorful, and well-portioned.\n\nThe overall cafe ambience was warm and welcoming, with just the right mix of cozy and vibrant. You can tell they care about both the details and the overall experience.\n\nGreat food, great vibes\u2014and genuinely kind people behind the counter. Will definitely be back!",

The warmly lit, narrow dining hall accommodates just over 170 diners, making advance reservations a must. Furnishings are comfortable, and tableware is immaculate. Decor strikes a balance between contemporary minimalist and traditional Oriental aesthetics, creating a sophisticated yet welcoming ambience.\n.\nService is attentive and efficient. Staff politely greet guests, showing them quickly to their seats, and demonstrating astute product knowledge with descriptions of the menu and its offerings. I note that staff proactively offer to clear finished plates throughout the meal, cleaning up quickly when diners leave. Advance reservations are also a breeze through the online platform.\n.\nFood is Chinese Cantonese cuisine. The kitchen is headed by Chef Aaron Tan, who serves up a dim sum ala-carte buffet on weekends and public holidays, priced at SGD $98++ per person. This gets you freshly prepared small tasting plates, unlimited in portion, made with quality ingredients and generally well executed. There's a range of over 40 dishes available, great value for money.",

We were seated at a table by the water's edge with great views of the Parliament and Supreme Court buildings across the river, passing sightseeing boats were fun to watch, and the Marina Bay Sands building could be seen in the distance. We ordered samosas, tikka chicken kabob, fried paneer, vegetable rice biryani, a mineral water bottle, and one beer. All of the food was delicious and was about $90 SGD. The staff was friendly and attentive and packed up our leftovers well. We definitely recommend trying this restaurant.",

They have a bar service where it is filled with quite a selection of wines, alcohol and cocktails to savor. Food is delicious! The staff are attentive and friendly.

    "review_text": "I had the best time at Pullman today with a friend! From start to finish, the service was top-notch. Kelvin, the supervisor, made us feel right at home, walking us through the menu and offering great recommendations. He really made us feel welcome! The bartender, Luke, absolutely nailed it with his drink suggestions, each one was perfectly crafted and complemented with our food. Chef Yi Hung was so kind to help us split our dishes into two portions, even though the restaurant was buzzing. It really meant a lot! To top it off, knowing it was my birthday, they surprised me with a birthday cake which was such a thoughtful touch. It\u2019s not often a restaurant goes above and beyond like that, but they totally did. Not to forget that one of the front office came up to find the supervisor to return my ID card as i dropped it at the lobby! All in all, a perfect meal and an unforgettable experience, will come visit again:)",

The food was genuinely amazing. We ordered the beef wagyu, crispy squid, chilli crab buns, satay, two cocktails, and a drink \u2014 everything was full of flavour and beautifully presented.\n\nWhat truly made the night special was the service. Kelvin, the supervisor, went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. He was friendly, thoughtful, and offered great food recommendations. The moment that really stood out was when he surprised us with a birthday cake and tea for my family \u2014 such a kind and unexpected gesture that made the evening feel personal and meaningful. The drinks were fantastic too \u2014 big thanks to Luke, the bartender, for crafting cocktails that perfectly complemented the meal.\n\nBetween the delicious food, warm service, and genuine hospitality from both Kelvin and Luke, Eden made my birthday celebration feel truly special. We\u2019ll definitely be back \u2014 and we\u2019ll be looking out for them again. Highly recommend!",

The ambience was gorgeous \u2014 designed like a greenhouse, it\u2019s the perfect spot to chill and catch up with loved ones.\n\nSpecial shoutout to their restaurant supervisor, Kelvin Johari, who went above and beyond to make our visit memorable. He noticed us fumbling with a self-timer camera and kindly offered to help take some shots for us. The photos turned out so good, it honestly felt like we were doing a pre-wedding shoot! \ud83d\ude02 Super attentive and thoughtful service like this really makes a difference.\n\nThe food was equally impressive. I absolutely loved the Hainanese Mac & Cheese \u2014 such a unique local twist done right. The Wagyu sirloin was another highlight, incredibly juicy and flavourful.\n\nOne small area for improvement would be the air-conditioning. While the greenhouse design is beautiful, we could barely feel any cooling \u2014 ended up perspiring throughout the meal. Hopefully this can be improved for a more comfortable dining experience.\n\nStill, would definitely return again for the great food and amazing service!",

I didnt get the names of the waiter and waitress who served us, but both were warm and friendly. This made our meal there very comfortable and definitely felt at home.\nI particularly love the open kitchen concept, where one can see the food being prepared on the spot. And the missus loves the eye candy in the open concept kitchen, Executive Chef Mr Peter Briks \ud83d\ude02 but was too shy to allow me to ask for a photo taken together.\nOk back to the food. The food was amazing! The last time I had such good Italian food was in Italy itself. Wholesome, hearty and amazingly fresh.\nIt would be even better if there is a complimentary bread basket on the table along with good olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Main reason for it is simply because we love to clear our plates with a good home made bread, how can we let any bit of amazing sauce or bits of to-die-for-food get rinsed off in the kitchen sink!\nThe bill is on the higher side but it was all damn worth it.\nAt the end of the meal, our dessert was served with a birthday candle for the missus and a polaroid photo of us was taken, clipped on a handwritten birthday card and given to us for keepsake. Although they do this for all their guests celebrating birthdays there, it is nevertheless heartwarming. But if the birthday card can be addressed by name to the birthday girl or boy, imagine the special  feeling that would bring.\nPlease maintain the quality and standards of your service and of course your food.\nWe will definitely be back!",

The Hokkaido grilled scallop was flawless - tender, soaked in butter and chilli oil which gave them the extra heat while the lime added some tanginess.

    "review_text": "What happens when a talented Italian chef got his heart broken?\n\nHe opens a modern restaurant in Singapore called \u2018Bottega di Carna\u2019. With a gigantic revolving stand of flowers and orchids dedicated to his former lover which the FedEx probably forget to delivery on time. With a neon of love poem displayed beside the bar, one that is too heartfelt not to be relatable.\n\nAnyways, the food here is rather fantastic! Joining the gang of gastronomic restaurants in Duxton Hill with the same feverish passion.\n\nI was told to try the steak because it\u2019s \u2019A steak house\u2019 but honestly the steaks are just above average and personally it isn\u2019t one of the top rankings group in Singapore. BUT their speciality is truly in things related to sauces.\n\n\ud83e\uddaa Hokkaido Scallop\nLarge soft scallops resting on so much fresh rocks of raw salts that can maybe, it can somewhat revive the death scallops. The sauce here is lightly spice but some sort buttery taste. It\u2019s seriously good!\n\n\ud83e\udd69 Ribeye\nSoft texture but don\u2019t expect much from a \u2018Grain fed\u2019 cow. If you\u2019re gonna get a sauce, Lo & Behold\u2014 The peppercorn isn\u2019t your average pepper sauce! If they were to cook black pepper crab with it, JUMBO Seafood will lose at least half its customers!\n\n\ud83c\udf70 Tiramisu\nSuper soft & wet cake (From heart broken chefs?) with lots of cream but the last layer at the bottom contains so much Kahlua or whatever secret booze, that you\u2019re very much likely to forget who your lover is/was for 24 hours\u2014 It\u2019s the Italian style.\n\nA lush greenery vibes with modern twist. Love the thoughtful seats with spine-level cushion. Chair and table was of perfect height combination for Asian descent. Attentive staff hustling all over. Great recipes\u2014 I would certainly invest my dollar in the sauce based dish.\n\nThanks Hari (Don\u2019t burn more of your hair from performing that flamboyant flaming dessert) & crew! \ud83c\udf38\ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

We enjoyed two perfectly cooked steaks, a great glass of wine, the creamiest mushroom soup (truly one of the best I\u2019ve had), and a delicious plate of pasta. Every dish was flavorful and clearly prepared with care.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the service. The team was incredibly attentive and thoughtful throughout our meal. A small but memorable gesture was when they split our pasta into two plates because my husband and I were sharing \u2013 and they did this before we even asked! It\u2019s little touches like that which make such a difference. The staff really made us feel looked after, and their attention to detail was impressive.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to relook into, it might be the furniture. The chairs, while beautiful, were a bit uncomfortable \u2013 the height with the table felt awkward, and the lack of proper support meant that many guests (including us) seemed to be sitting in strange postures.\n\nOverall, we left so impressed with the food, the service, and the overall atmosphere. If you\u2019re looking for a great meal paired with thoughtful service, Bottega di Carna is definitely worth a visit.",

With natural light flooding in during the day and an artistic, cozy vibe in the evening, it\u2019s a perfect spot for any meal. The whimsical rotating Christmas tree and thoughtfully curated art pieces add a unique charm, while the lush garden area outside offers a serene escape in the middle of the city.\n\nI highly recommend trying the Lobster Parpadelle\u2014a standout dish during my dinner. The flavors were rich and satisfying, making it a must-have. Breakfast was equally delightful, with a great variety to start the day on the right note.\n\nBottega di Carna combines gorgeous surroundings with delicious food, making it a great spot for hotel guests and visitors alike.

The food, service, and ambiance came together seamlessly, creating an unforgettable lunch.\n\nThe meal began with a welcoming touch: The bread was wonderfully soft on the inside, and the olive oil was rich and fragrant.\n\nThe Burrata salad was a highlight, offering a perfect harmony of flavors. The creamy, fresh cheese paired beautifully with the vibrant salad ingredients, showcasing a masterful balance of simplicity and sophistication. It\u2019s a dish that not only delighted the palate but also demonstrated the restaurant\u2019s commitment to quality ingredients.\n\nThe 150-day grain-fed Black Angus Ribeye was another standout. Cooked flawlessly to medium rare, the steak was tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. Each bite reflected the exceptional quality of the meat and the skill of the kitchen. It\u2019s a must-try for any steak enthusiast and a testament to the restaurant\u2019s expertise in delivering elevated dishes.\n\nThe seabass, while well-cooked and fresh, didn\u2019t quite match the wow factor of the other dishes. It lacked the boldness or creativity that made the rest of the meal shine. It felt more understated, which may appeal to some, but it wasn\u2019t as memorable compared to the rest of the offerings.\n\nOverall, Bottega di Carna left a lasting impression with its outstanding food, thoughtful service. From the complimentary bread and olive oil to the main dishes, every detail reflected the restaurant\u2019s dedication to providing an exceptional dining experience. Despite minor critiques, we left feeling thoroughly impressed.",

You're paying for the great service, nice atmosphere, convenient location, etc. Nonetheless, had a great time!",

His recommendations were also stellar and helped us to order the right amount for an enjoyable experience.\n\nFood wise, we loved the Cauliflower \u2014 slightly sweet and spicy, paired really well together with the Pork dish which was more on the savoury side. Cook of the pork was excellent, with a slight pink in the middle. However, beans weren\u2019t our favourite, seems like it doesn\u2019t go that well together but that\u2019s could just be our preference.\n\nPici was flavourful and a good recommendation by Hari as well. Artichoke tart was interesting albeit goat cheese is still the forefront flavour profile, so if not a cheese fan might not recommend.\n\nThey even gave a complimentary Tiramisu for birthday celebration, super thoughtful.\n\nOverall, ambience was great, service was splendid and food was incredible. Will definitely be back to try more dishes! Thank you Hari!",

The food was beautifully executed, full of flavour and creativity, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was lively yet intimate \u2013 perfect for a relaxed catch-up dinner.\n\nWhat truly made the evening exceptional, however, was the service from Martin. His initiative, genuine attentiveness, and warm professionalism stood out from the moment we were seated. He anticipated our needs before we even asked, offered thoughtful recommendations, and checked in on us just the right amount without ever interrupting the flow of conversation. He came over to chat with us too, and made us feel so welcome and well taken care of \u2013 it elevated the dinner from great to unforgettable.\n\nThank you to Martin and the team for such a wonderful evening. I will definitely be back soon. I had hoped to thank him personally at the end of the evening but couldn't get him at the end, nor could his colleague. So I hope this message gets to him in the end!",

Just a special shout out to the restaurant manager for offering us a free dessert after a mix up with the staff. We asked if the restaurant is still serving the pasta that is prepared with the cheese wheel, and the staff said no. However, this was not true as we saw it being served to other tables later. This was when the manager came to apologise to us saying that it is only served when he is there. He offered to prepare one for us but we were already full by then. It is a pity though, but the rest of the food is equally amazing. Just remember to ask for the salt to go with any of the steaks, it truly elevates the flavour and makes the meat extra tasty.",

For this bespoke experience, I got a drink called 'Southside' which is gin-based, with lemon juice and syrup.\n\nThe Artichoke Tart was aesthetically pleasing and fun to eat. Loved the first cheese and honey combo.\n\nThe fried calamari was flavourful with crisp golden brown batter.\n\nThe pumpkin ravioli was of a nice bright hue and inside, there's cacioricotta cheese.\n\nMy favourite dish, would be the stockyard ribeye. I think I can eat the whole plate on my own!\n\nFor dessert, the chocolate fondant was very likeable. On top of that, the staff brought out ice cream (complete with lighted candles) for the birthday girl.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the dining experience here as I can feel the thoughtfulness/attentiveness of the Chefs and the staff towards their guests.",

While most lamb racks disappoint due to this protein\u2019s difficult nature, Bottega di Carna nailed it. It was wonderful and we would return just for that over our usual preference of steak (which we had, but it wasn\u2019t that memorable).\n\nWe ended off with tiramisu (of course), and we wished the serving for two could be more than that.\n\nI had a glass of red recommended by the waiter, a Richard Hamilton Colton\u2019s GSM.

I am not really a health foodie so I\u2019ve always been skeptical about zucchini noodles but wow it was a refreshing and palate-cleansing starter! The spice level of the Cauli with harissa also really hit the spot. Of course the steak was really good but I think the other dishes stole the show for me \ud83d\ude05 the caviar spaghetti was also surprising with citrus zest offsetting the heavy creamy sauce. Looking forward to trying everything else on the menu!\n\nService wise, the staff were also impeccable. Felt like I was back in the US. Warm, friendly but not in your face hovering sort of table service. Was a really great experience all around!",

We were here for the first time to celebrate a birthday, and we found the food to be very good.\n\nThe stockyard 200-day grain fed bone-in strip loin that we ordered was grilled to a perfect medium rare and had that smokey char, with a good balance of fat to meat ratio - just enough to be juicy and tender but not too much. This was a favourite for sure.\n\nThe whole branzino (it\u2019s a European sea bass) was also josper-grilled and deboned; with olive oil, garlic, capers, olives and lemon. A clean-tasting fish with crispy grilled skin.\n\nThe pumpkin ravioli, one of their vegetarian handmade pastas, was filled with feta cheese, and the pumpkin sauce was delicious.\n\nThe creamed spinach comes topped with a sunny side up egg. Arguably one of the best renditions of creamed spinach I\u2019ve tasted and definitely worth an order.\n\nThe chocolate fondant was delicious, and so too was the lemon givre (described as a lemon tart without the crust, and comes with Prosecco jelly under a bed of meringue in a lemon half-shell).\n\nService was excellent. The waitstaff were very attentive and kept coming around often to refill our water and make sure we were comfortable. Food is pricey for sure, but this restaurant is nonetheless very much worth a revisit for special occasions.",

    "review_text": "Bottega Di Carna stands out among celebrity restaurants, defying the usual underwhelming experiences that come with fame. Nestled within the Mondrian Singapore Duxton hotel, this contemporary Italian eatery is the outpost of the famed Tuscan butcher Dario Cecchini, hailed for his appearances on Netflix's Chef's Table and his impressive clientele including Elton John, Anthony Bourdain, and King Charles. Dubbed the \"World's Greatest Butcher\" by the New York Times, Cecchini infuses the restaurant with his mastery of butchery and bold creativity. The menu highlights flame-kissed meats alongside homemade pastas, charcuterie, fresh seafood, and a variety of classic and unconventional meat cuts.\n\nAppetizers dazzle with options like zesty Seabass Crudo and perfectly crisped golden Calamari, while the savoury, cheesy Parmigiana delights the palate. Vegetarian offerings such as cold zucchini noodles with basil pesto and roasted cauliflower with spiced honey, almond, thyme, and garlic provide flavourful options for non-meat eaters. Pastas are authentic: the Pici Bolognese comes with a rich and hearty Bolognese sauce simmered to perfection with aromatic onions, garlic, and tomatoes, mingling with savory shredded beef braised for 8 hours till tender, finished with a touch of fresh herbs and a hint of red wine - kudos to Chef Kenny Huang who honed his craft in Turin for several years.\n\nSeated at the open kitchen, diners can observe the culinary magic firsthand. The restaurant's vibrant, playful, and elegant interior, coupled with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the outdoor garden, creates a picturesque setting for a memorable birthday celebration, topped by attentive and professional service.",

My favourite part about this restaurant is how nice the interior design/furniture choice is! We ordered the steak tartare, beef carpaccio, pici pasta and chocolate fondant. Price was reasonable compared to other similar-category Italian restaurants. The wine menu was concise which is good. Prices start at $18 per glass/$90 per bottle for the Italian reds. Service staff were friendly and attentive but perhaps overly zealous as they were eager to clear my plate even while I was still eating. Nonetheless we will be back again to try the steak and tiramisu which we did not have the capacity for during this visit.\n*Note that parking is $5/hour (so you can plan your visit better)",

The appetisers and desserts were great, but what really stole the show was the mains. The beef cheek was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the grilled chicken and red snapper were perfectly seasoned. It's honestly difficult to pick a favourite dish, as each was well executed.\n\nWhat truly set this restaurant apart, though, was the service. The staff were incredibly attentive without being intrusive, and brought us extra plates and utensils for sharing, even before we had to ask. A special mention goes to a gentleman from Nepal (I didn\u2019t catch his name), who made sure we were well taken care of throughout the meal and checked in on us regularly.\n\nWhile it may not be the most accessible spot to get to, it\u2019s certainly worth the visit. We'll definitely be back if we get the chance.",

We had the signature steak tartare and the grilled scallop as the starters. The steak tartare alone is worth the trip to the restaurant.\n\nFor our mains we tried the ribeye and the Branzini. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the bearnaise was the best bearnaise I have had in Singapore. However the Branzini was the best dish we had by far. If you cook your own ribeyes, you might be better of trying their other dishes.\n\nThe service was not perfect, we had to top up our own glasses and we had to ask for steak knives after our main dishes were served. These are issues that can be solved easily . However we will definitely visit this restaurant again in the near future.",

While multiple visits to one spot isn\u2019t my thing, I make a fine exception for Mondrian. Jungle Ballroom, Christina, been to them and now I tick Bottega off in my list. What a stunning space. Smart design ensures a fluid entrance into the restaurant, which welcomes you after you do your selfies in the stunning lift. No entrance. Just greeted by the expanse of stunning design. Some oxymorons - a pescatarian stepping foot into a butchers restaurant. We were here for a birthday, I burnt with excitement to plant ourselves in a luxe atmosphere. Pescatarian diet is possible in a luxe butcher's stop. We had the apperitvo set - drink with selection of fine cold cuts (not for me), cheese, olives and focaccia. Be sure to get the artichoke tarts - these tiny morsels pack taste bombs. Then calamari is perfectly fried and the spinach with fried egg is such a pleasing sight and the creamed spinach is a scream. We wanted to get seabass crudo but was full. On a sweet note, the birthday tiramisu was on the house, a surprise to me. The entire experience from top-notch ambiance, to food to service, is perfect. Mondrian Duxton deserves her queen spot in my book. #eatstylishtravelstylish",

    "review_text": "Opening in June 2023 as the in-house restaurant of the Mondrian Singapore Duxton hotel, Bottega Di Carna is a modern Italian restaurant offering an elegant, refined dining experience. Headlined by \"The World's Greatest Butcher\" and meat maverick Dario Cecchini, with Executive Chef Alastair Clayton and Chef De Cuisine Kenny Huang, Bottega Di Carna offers playful and creative plates that pay homage to the gourmet ingredients used.\n.\nAmbience at Bottega Di Carna calls to mind a Wes Anderson film set. Bright natural lights filter through the vast skylight, casting soft diffused light upon the gentle pastel coloured walls, marble-topped tables, and cushioned booth seats. Greenery within and without, quirky cursive fonts in the decorative wall scripts, and rounded mirrors lend the signature feel. A large open bar and open kitchen offers a view of the activity.\n.\nService at Bottega Di Carna befits its status as a fine dining establishment. Staff accord each table personalised attention, demonstrating good product knowledge in describing dishes or beverages. They fulfil requests efficiently, and clean up quickly when diners leave. Great that they engage guests in conversation, and also check during the meal for feedback. Service recovery processes are decently defined and executed.\n.\nFood at Bottega Di Carna is modern Italian fine dining cuisine, with a focused menu comprising use of gourmet ingredients. No surprise that meat is a highlight, with exquisite aged cuts of beef flame-kissed by their josper grill. Handmade pastas and inventive appetizers round it out. Portions are sized for individuals but can be shared. Prices are relatively high, budget about SGD $97 per person for a meal with drinks here.",

A true expression of the Mondrian concept captivating community, heritage, art, fashion\u2026 pillars of a modern globe..\n\nRefined Dining comes alive at the latest modern Italian dining place by Dario Cecchini. We went to Bottega di Carna at the newly commissioned eloquent modern hotel right in the heart of Duxton, bringing excitement and life to this vicinity - the  @mondriansingapore which is a vibrant modern Italian eatery, the brainchild of Dario Cecchini, who is also known as \u201cThe Greatest Butcher in The World.\u201d\n\nAn entire array of playful yet delightful gastronomic Italian classics were showcased upon us with elements of Dario\u2019s rebellious spin in an awesome culinary format. We sampled the SEABASS CRUDO consisting of grilled zucchini, lemon & marioram oil - so wonderful as I have not tasted anything like this before; the DARIO'S SIGNATURE STEAK TARTARE was amazing with a neat selection of smoked paprika, olive oil and lemon and the CARPACCIO DI CULO with seiso verde was just amazing!\n\nThe lovely Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label Champagne was a trustworthy companion that brought out finesse when paired with this bevy of starters combination.\n\nFor the main course, we chose the BRANZINO FILET comprising  grilled artichoke & salsa verde, exquisitely done and also the STOCKYARD RIBEYE 280Gm .. Australian Black Angus.. immaculate!\n\nWe couldn\u2019t leave without dessert so we were given a taste of the VALRHONA CHOCOLATE FONDANT - a selezzione of cocoa nib tuile and homemade vanilla ice cream and also the TIRAMISU which is served at the table for two pax, love\n\nOverall Rating : 9.3/10\nHighly Recommended",

But for starters, those who have a penchant for seafood might partake in their Seabass Crudo, which comes with grilled zucchini, lemon and marjoram oil. Ever heard of cucumber yoghurt before? You will be surprised at how it pairs so well with their Lamb Cutlets and eggplant caviar.\n\nAlso, check out their monthly signatures from time to time or catch their Sunday Roasts, Weekday Set Lunch, and Saturday Brunch menus to switch up your appetite occasionally.",

Service was spectacular and in particular, Burn was fantastic - naturally charismatic and pays good attention to what your preferences and recommending complementary dishes. All in all a great night!",

I like to personally commend floor lead Mr hari saravanan for his examplary customer satisfaction in handling diners feedback. I order their signature steak tartare, ribeye steak. My pasta was frst delivered uncooked and he promptly had it recook again. After ending the meal. He asked if everything was OK. I told him the pasta was still not exactly good and he offered to extend me some desserts which I kindly refused as I'm not a dessert person. After handling the bill he offered to write off the pasta and i tried to politely decline and say it doesn't matter. He took it in his stride that he wants to offer diners the best. Such examples are rarely seen in today's restaurant dining. His willingness to serve and offer a complete dining experience was heartwarming. I have yet to try other other food on the menu. Will definitely be back again.",

One of our favourite dishes wasn\u2019t on the brunch menu, but the team graciously checked with the chef\u2014and to our delight, they made it happen!\n\nThe service was impeccable throughout\u2014warm, attentive, and thoughtful. They even assisted us with wheelchair access for my mother-in-law, making sure she was comfortable and well taken care of.

Short of actually sending a valet service to pick us from the car park, it was indeed a nice touch. Food has improved significantly from before. We ordered 4 mains  - crab spaghettini, halibut, chicken and the ribs and 2 light mains - pulled beef and burrata. Loved the spaghettini, halibut and the chicken, ribs were so so.. or could it be because we were already quite stuffed when it was finally served? :). Service was excellent from John and Chan - Attentive without being intrusive. New plates were changed fairly frequently. Atmosphere could have been better had it not been raining - they had to put the blinds down to stop the rain from coming in but it still was rather cosy with nice subtle lighting. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience this time around. Thanks to John, Chan, Francis, the chef and staff of the Halia again for making it a nice night out for the family.",

And yes, Tian Tian Chicken Rice lives up to the hype\u2014moist, flavorful chicken, fragrant rice, and a chili sauce that hits just right. It\u2019s legendary for a reason.\n\nBut what really makes Maxwell stand out is the variety. From crispy Fuzhou oyster cakes to comforting fish soup, laksa, dim sum, and even fresh sugarcane juice, there\u2019s something here to satisfy every craving. I loved that many of the stalls have been run by the same families for generations\u2014you can really taste the passion in every bite.\n\nThe food is incredibly affordable, portions are generous, and everything is served fresh and fast. Seating is communal and casual, which only adds to the charm\u2014just grab a tray, find a seat, and dig in.\n\nIf you want to eat like a local and experience the soul of Singapore\u2019s food culture, Maxwell Food Centre is a must-visit. I\u2019ve been twice on this trip alone, and I\u2019d go back again in a heartbeat.\n\nRating: 5/5",

I was so disappointed not to see it again, but then I went all around and guess what? Found at least ten booths with amazingly good food. And I never tried even a quarter of them. Not enough time and my stomach is not big enough. Ask anything, if they speak good enough English, they will explain. If not, not to worry.

The curry paste tasted like Thai panang curry, but milder. It came with a dipping sauce that reminded me of Thai chili shrimp paste with a sour and salty kick and bits of shallot. I loved it so much I wanted to bring some home.\n\nI also had grilled chicken wings with crispy skin that felt almost like roast duck. And of course, we had mixed satay with pork, chicken, and shrimp. We ordered a small set, and even with three people, we couldn\u2019t finish it all. The satay was really good and there are so many stalls to explore. I also tried the garlic fried prawns and they were packed with flavor.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Singapore, this is a must-visit spot. Great food, local vibe, not expensive, and super satisfying.",

If you don't mind the wait (about 30 mins to get the food), then this is the place for you. If you don't like waiting , there's like 7 other stalls , some with more exotic items than others. I saw stall 6 had satay squid and coconut rice in addition to the normal chicken , beef , and shrimp. If I had more room I would've tried it!\n\nAs of the inside, there's plenty of seatings. If you like to be outside and have an ice cold beer, there's seats for that too! Do not miss out on lau pa sat!",

Or you can just ask them.\n\nThe food is good, although I've only tried one dish so far.\n\nMost of the food here is self-service. You place your own order, and you need to return your food tray to the designated area based on halal or non-halal categories.",

It seems like it's a great hang out place for CBD office gangs as well as for those who like to visit Merlion afterwards in which we did. So it's a great combination to visit Lau Pa Sat and after that we walked to One Fullerton area and Merlion place. Evening stroll is amazing and the weather was nice for us. From Merlion side you can potentially see the music water fountain from Marina Bay Sands as well. What a wonderful sight to visit especially after fulfilled dinner at Lau Pa Sat.",

A great way to have dinner out, the only complaint is the heat which on a night like today will get extreme. Highly recommend a visit there.",

There are also a lot of other food to try, including halal food.\nThe place is clean, all thanks to the super efficient cleaners.\nMaybe a bit warm in the afternoon, best to sit at the table near the fans. And luckily, there are many fans around.\n\nDo note of the queue during peak period and the need to queue for a car park slot as well.\nBest to avoid the lunch crowd!\n\nA sure must go place to eat!\nStrongly recommended.",

The coconut rice is fragrant and fluffy, cooked to perfection without being overly rich. The sambal is the real star \u2013 slightly sweet, with a nice spicy kick that lingers just enough to make you crave the next bite.\n\nTheir fried chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy inside, well-marinated and full of flavor. The ikan bilis and peanuts are super crunchy, and the egg is always cooked just right. Everything is served hot and fresh, even during busy hours.\n\nPortion sizes are generous for the price, and the service is friendly and efficient. Whether you\u2019re here for a quick lunch or a hearty breakfast, this nasi lemak will hit the spot. Highly recommended for both locals and tourists looking for authentic local flavors!",

Parking can be hard to find at time as it's a small lot.

He gave my son wafer while waiting for the food to be ready.\n\nRojak was great but quite small portion for the price.\n\nBBQ seafood and satay look very appealing however it look like it might take longer waiting time that I didn't order.",

Couldn\u2019t decide which of the two long nasi lemak queues to join so I went for the chicken rice with a slightly shorter queue. Chicken was over cooked but flavorful and the rice was really nice. Picked up a carrot cake from the nice woman across the way. This carrot cake has since become one of my favorites. The chef only burnt it the first time but since he knows my face, each time has been great! Highly recommend. Overall, would happily return to this place but not at peak lunch hours.",

They are open everyday, from 11am- 8pm! Aunty makes and takes the orders herself so please be patient with them as queuing time might take a bit longer during peak periods. Their prices are affordable and soup is complimentary too. The menu has a wide variety that also caters to kids and she fries the fried items upon orders so you are guaranteed freshness. I am a picky chicken rice eater so her stall is my go- to whenever I'm around the area.",

Ambience is good and place is well ventilated. Some food to recommend include prawn noodles, nasi lemak, Indian rojak, satay, fried carrot cakes and fresh fruit juices.

It is located near the Botanic Garden station. Their food selection I think pretty limited particularly because of the limited space. Yes, this hawker center is pretty small for my standard. One of the best delicacies here is the Nasi Lemak. I choose the Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak stall because it highly rated on Google, and also it has long queue of locals. A complete meal cost only SGD 6.00, which pretty affordable for Singaporean standard. It tastes great with rich flavor on the rice and the chicken. Their sambal was not spicy, but rather going to the sweet side. Overall, an enjoyable experience for me.",

The prawn noodles here are famous for a reason\u2014perfectly cooked noodles, juicy prawns, and that rich, flavorful broth that always hits the spot. It\u2019s the kind of dish that warms you up and leaves you fully satisfied.\n\nA tip for anyone visiting: come early or late if you want to avoid the parking woes. The food centre is quite popular, and parking can get tricky during peak hours. However, despite its popularity, Adam Food Centre never feels too crowded or too hot, making it a comfortable place to enjoy your meal. The open-air seating and well-ventilated space contribute to a pleasant dining experience, even when it\u2019s busy.\n\nNo meal here is complete without a refreshing sugarcane drink from The Sugarcane Plant. There\u2019s nothing quite like washing down a hearty bowl of prawn noodles with an ice-cold sugarcane drink. It\u2019s the perfect way to recharge and feel refreshed, especially if you\u2019re heading back to work. The combination of comfort food and a revitalizing drink makes for a fantastic lunch break.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a regular or a first-timer, Adam Food Centre offers a great selection of local hawker fare, with Noo Cheng Prawn Noodles and a sugarcane drink topping my list every time.",

It's also extremely busy so vendors are very business-like rather than chatty.  Many may not speak much English and be more conversant with customers who speak Mandarin or another language.  Order from the vendor you want and pay them directly, wait for your food and then try to find a table to sit at.  Great experience!",

As all the early birds have occupied it. Most came in groups, due to this the seating is occupied. Some of the familiar stall holder are no longer around, which I learnt from my friends. The hassle of eating here are still around. Maybe will visit again this hawker centre after 5 years.",

So many drink shops with \"teh tarik\" and all kind snacks.\n\nHugeparking space but still streets nearby full parking usually no space at all meal times with parking warriors mercilessly issuing summons 24/7.\n\nJust accross the two street Bukit Timah and Dunearn Road is botanical gardens, next to Cold Storage. Really a scenic corner of greenery such that Adam Roads Food Centre toilets are designed in open green trees concept. Pay 10 cents to old man for clean upkeep and toilet paper and soap.\n\nIt is great space for afternoon tea into dinner. Not much beer drinkers as crowds wait to take over departing diners.

    "review_text": "This hawker stall is visible across the street from Botanic Gardens Station via the overpass or crossing. In Korea, it's like a local food court.\n\nI ordered the small fried oyster at No. 22, the chicken rice set (roasted and steamed half and half, with extra meat) at No. 23, and the Power Avocado at No. 29.\n\nThe fried oyster, unlike what you'd find in Korea, was a stir-fried oyster, egg, and meat dish. It's delicious dipped in sauce and should be eaten while it's still hot. It's even better when mixed with the rice that came with the chicken rice.\n\nThe chicken rice set was delicious with the owner's homemade chili sauce. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the bones were removed, making it easy to eat. The broth tasted like chicken broth you'd get at a milmyeon restaurant, and the bok choy was also good. Above all, the owner was cheerful and friendly. The spicy Sri Cha Cha egg stir-fry, which wasn't on the menu, was especially delicious, but it's a shame they don't sell it. It's difficult to grind and grind the sauce myself, so it's hard to offer it on the menu. The food is delicious, so I highly recommend it!\n\nThe Power Avocado is served shaved ice, filling and delicious. This place is famous for their Avocado + Banana Mix (No. 2), but I couldn't eat it that day because they didn't have any bananas.\n\nAside from that, Rojak (No. 19) has its own distinct flavor profile, but I found it quite enjoyable. The peanuts, sauce, and other ingredients all contributed to the flavors. I enjoyed the pineapple and cucumber inside, but the wheat bread didn't quite suit me. I think it's because the texture was a bit dry. Still, it's worth it.\n\nFinally, the ginger milk tea was delicious and warm.\n\nThere are more locals than tourists here, and there are also police officers and high school students, so I guess that's why the prices are relatively affordable and the food is delicious. After ordering and paying, you can pick up your food when it's your turn. After you're done, you can return it to the non-hala (tray) in the center. A separate staff member will clear your table. It's an open space with fans, so it can be a bit hot, but it's a fun place to enjoy a local atmosphere. Parking is available, and the place is clean. There are also clean restrooms. Please note that the entire restaurant may be closed on certain days for food preparation or cleaning.\n\n*2025.7.31.",

    "review_text": "As I tucked into this Mee Rebus with extras for my occasional cheat day craving this brings back memories of familiar starter morning kick off to a work day during my madmen days. The one that got a late old friend all excited not realising that this gem is actually just around the corner from his place when he popped back home. Alas he's no longer here but with each bite a piece of the many memories we shared is rekindled \ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb\n\nA lot has changed at this food centre. The long queues for the two famous nasi lemak are no longer so evident. The first with the relatively unfriendly makcik stayed the same but the overhyped one that spawned Crave sadly allowed commercialism to spiral their own brand of nasi lemak into expensive blahness. Notably the (in)famous headband auntie with her stupendous famous Mee Soto with the delicious soup is long gone with her. We started not having friendly interaction for she was garang and uncommunicative but we ended up exchanging good tidings when my wife and I bid her well as she battled cancer when we met her in a wheelchair. She left not only with her quietly supportive kind husband who also passed but along with their memorable signature Mee Soto which I used to have with chicken feet and gizzard with the kick of her special chilli sauce.\n\nLuckily this old skool style thick gravy Mee Rebus is continued by the friendly and sweet adik helper taking over from the Pak Haji who used to tend to the stall.\n\nSo with each bite I'm allowing the flood of memories to just bring back to the good old times here.",

Decided to go for the Mee Soto and Mee Rebus stall to order a regular mee soto soup with chicken meat slices and noodles. We are not disappointed as the soup was savoury, rich in spices, dark in favour with their own blend of chilli. Finished off the meal with sugar cane juice with lemon, a good respite from the warm weather as most of us were sweating buckets after the walk. This time around, I did not go for the Adam Road Nasi Lemak, nor the Adam Chicken rice as it was not opened. Will come back to try any other time!",

My friend queued for the nasi lemak for about 30 mins.\n\nThankfully, the crowd thinned when it rained heavily. Managed to try the ais kacang at the dessert stall, and it was good! The shaved ice was soft, ingredients aplenty and delicious. The lady taking orders was friendly and would remember your table if they took your order in advance for desserts still in preparation.\n\nThe boneless chicken rice was not bad, but quite expensive for the portion of chicken.\n\nMinus one star for this food centre due to the crowd. Probably best to takeaway instead of dining in.",

    "review_text": "TEH HALIYAH MEETS CARROT CAKE\n\nAdam\u2019s food centre is home to many famous stalls in the island. Well known for Nasi Lemak, Indian Rojak and Mutton Soup, it is a relatively small food centre with a semi open-air, Hexagonal arrangement right beside the Adam\u2019s flyover.\n\nThe Hawker centre is emotionally attached to me since my first visit in 2014. Whenever I step into this area, along with nostalgia, I look for two items: a bottle of chilled beer from aunty\u2019s stall and a $5 dark (Singaporean) Carrot Cake with chilli. I am surprised that not many people have mentioned the stall in their super list of Chai Tow Kway, but if I were to make one, this stall would top the list. But the two are closely followed by Teh Haliyah served by the Ronaldinho look-alike Malaysian Indian hawker. This time, I chose the ginger tea over Beer, simply to try a new combination.\n\nWe rarely get a proper visual access to the wok where the chopstick licking Carrot Cake gets done. But the orders are taken with all possible customizations. After a short wait, you could claim your piping hot carrot cake served in a leaf shaped green plate. I strongly recommend that you take no additives like chilli or sauce, but grab a plastic spoon to scrape out the tastiest final remains of sauce from the plate.\n\nOn the other side, it make no sense to watch Ronaldinho making Teh Haliyah. It happens in a time shorter than your brain would take process it. He quickly fills the Teh glass with black tea and strong ginger water and then performs a \u201cscoop - throw\u201d trick to transfer condensed milk from tin to glass. At this stage, most of the tea makers just give it a quick stir and serve. This guy adds tarik (a pull technique) to it to give you a 007 level \u201cShaken, not stirred\u201d mix.\n\nThe ingredients in the two dishes complement each other perfectly that makes one  plug into nirvana. Fried garlic in the carrot cake combines with the ginger water to strike  the roots of our taste buds while caramelized sugar neutralises the bitter tea to add a new flavour to the milk. Its less likely that you won\u2019t slurp the carrot cake and finish off the tea in minutes. And beware, you may feel warm and even sweat after the treat. So it is better to sit under the fan for a while, before you decide to leave.",

Tried the fried carrot cake and malay chicken soup. Both didn't disappoint. I remember many other good stalls too(from my dunearn hostel days)\nThis is definitely an overlooked hawker centre( by tourists). Can rival Newton Centre, Tiong Bahru, and other more famous ones in quality.\nA must for hawker foodie.",

Try the Royal Rumble menu, the most complete choice of nasi lemak with its sides: fried chicken, fried fish, fried egg, otah (kinda fish cake with asian spices), and potato perkedel (mashed potato batter with egg and fried). The trivia is: President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo and the sultan of Brunei loves this dish so much that they had this as breakfast when they visit Singapore.",

Some stalls are even Michelin-listed.\n\nOne can find a huge variety of local favourite dishes here - from smoky wok hei noodles & rich curry chicken bee hoon, to bak chor mee, Hokkien mee & even traditional desserts. Prices are fair & portions generous. Expect long queues at popular stalls, especially during the lunch rush (12 - 1:30\u202fPM).\n\nSeating can get a little tight & warm during peak hours, but the atmosphere is vibrant & authentically local. A must-visit for anyone wanting to experience real Singapore hawker culture.",

    "review_text": "If you\u2019re chasing the ultimate plate of fried kway teow in Singapore, this legendary stall at Hong Lim Market & Food Centre is my top pick. Every visit feels like a reunion with comfort food done right.\n\nThe \u201cwok hei\u201d here is unmistakable\u2014smoky, intense, and deeply satisfying. And that signature pork lard smile? It\u2019s not just a garnish, it\u2019s a promise. Crispy, golden bits that elevate every bite with rich, indulgent flavor.\n\nThe uncle behind the wok is a master of his craft. He\u2019s meticulous with every plate\u2014balancing sauces, controlling heat, and portioning ingredients with care. You can see the seriousness in his movements, and taste it in the results. Occasionally, a younger assistant takes over when the uncle\u2019s on break. While the finesse may vary slightly, the taste still holds up well and is worth trying.\n\nBe prepared to wait, especially during lunch rush. But honestly? The queue is part of the experience. It builds the anticipation\u2014and the reward is always worth it.\n\nThis stall consistently satisfies my cravings. It\u2019s a stall that respects tradition, delivers bold flavors, and never compromises on quality. Whether you\u2019re a local or just visiting, this is one plate you shouldn\u2019t miss.",

While the prices are slightly on the higher side, the quality of the food and service reflects the value.\n\nWe ordered several dishes. The truffle eggs croissant was nice, with perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs enhanced by the rich aroma of truffle, all nestled in a buttery, flaky croissant. It was flavorful and satisfying.\n\nThe rosti with sausage is my favorite. The potatoes were shredded finely and pan-fried to golden, crispy perfection. Smoked salmon was included at no extra cost and the sausage (+$2) added a hearty and savory touch to the dish.\n\nFor dessert, the waffle with strawberries and vanilla ice cream stood out. The waffle was light yet crispy, with a generous portion of strawberries that added a tangy balance to the creamy vanilla ice cream. It was a sweet and satisfying end to the meal.\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely place to enjoy a meal when you\u2019re looking to treat yourself.",

Driving there was a challenge as parking was within a service apt which was out of our expectation.\n\nFood was very nice, although expensive. Waffle cost $15 each but very worth our calories. It was moist inside and crispy outside. It felt light and not taste all flour. We tried their new ah boy laksa gen Z style. Also quite nice although the sauce tasted more like chilli crab than laksa.",

The waffles was perfect for brunch moments and increase the business owner kind o brunch vibes. Atmosphere was so chill for a Saturday afternoon.

Booking is highly recommended. Food quality is on the very satisfactory side. From the way it is cooked, the taste and presentation gives me the idea that the owner of the place had paid attention to satisfy the customers. Coffee was on point too.",

First of all, the latte was pretty awesome - strong but not overly bitter or burnt, milky but not insipid, with a rich flavour. I didn't have anything else, but the menu was quite varied with all kinds of brunch food.\n\nNext, let's talk about the ambience. It was very bright and airy on a weekend morning, , with various types of set ups. You like normal table and chairs? You can sit on those. You like counter type seats? They have you sorted out too. Bar stools and tables? Yup, they have those? Sofa seats? Scoot right in. You have kids? High chairs, children's cutlery and even children's books are available to save the helpless parent. Best of all, power plugs are also pretty much everywhere, so feel free to use your laptop over food and drinks to get some work in.\n\nLastly, while service wasn't particularly exceptional, I got everything I needed without being intruded upon, as all kinds of utensils and necessities are available right at the counter, and everyone was chill about my toddler walking and climbing and blabbering throughout my patronage.\n\nWould definitely go again if I'm in the area.",

    "review_text": "I've been here for a couple of times now and just tried their new seasonal menu. I ordered the entr\u00e9e, A Barramundi's Voyage, and the dessert, Sweet Dreams Made In Thai.\n\nA Barramundi's Voyage has great taste with the spicy coconut broth. Tangy and savory with a hint of spiciness make the dish not feel as 'heavy' as it seems. The portion was fairly good. The protein was not dry or tough. I'm not really a fan of fish, but this dish has proved to me that fish can be as good as beef! :)\n\nThe mushrooms and potato leaves, together with the fish and broth, make a great combination of texture and flavor in your mouth. Honestly, I wished the dish was endless.\n\nThe dessert, Sweet Dreams Made In Thai, has a strong tropical flavor with bits of chopped mangoes on top. There was a slight citrus taste to the mango mousse, which made it really refreshing and light.\n\nThe mango mousse may have overpowered the taste of the coconut cream, but nonetheless, the cream together with the mousse was great. The cake was surprisingly not dry as it was sandwiched between the mousse. On top of that, the brown rice puff enhanced the overall texture and feel of the dessert.\n\nWas really glad that I tried it and will definitely recommend this seasonal menu to anyone's visiting!",

I also tried their crabmeat alio olio on a separate occasion and it was nice! Just remember to ask for less spicy if you can't take spicy.\n\nWhat's good is that they have a wide range of food with western and Asian options. My mum ordered the Grandma Lee's congee and it was really good as well!\n\nThese were ok: steak and eggs, beef bowl rice - the rice is the short grain sticky type, which some may like, but I prefer rice that's less sticky. Rosti with pork bratwurst - my family said it would have been nicer if it were crispier.\n\nWould definitely come back for more.",

Could have easily been shared among 2-3 people!\n\nThe curry was made in-house and was tasty and not too salty \u2014 I was told dark chocolate was one of the ingredients that was meant to add a savoury/slightly bitter aftertaste. The katsu cutlet was very crispy and breaded to perfection. In terms of the drinks, the chai latte could have included more chai.\n\nThe cafe was spacious and looked like a part of it was catered towards working folks (abundance of power plugs, free wifi, comfortable seats). We were able to sit there for a few undisturbed hours doing our own things, which I would say made up for the pricier food in return.",

Also tried their scone w in-house made jam (also good)\nCafe appears to be laptop friendly as there are a couple of tables with people studying or working on their laptops which is not common for cafes nowadays but it\u2019s a welcome change.\nOverall had a happy lunch",

There are also multiple charging outlets to charge your devices.\n\nI ordered their Acai Bowl and Madame\u2019s Truffled Egg Croissant. Their Acai Bowl is topped generously with fresh fruits and nuts and is not overly sweet. The splash of soy milk makes the consistency of the acai smoother. As for their Truffled Egg Croissant: The croissant was buttery and flaky, while the egg was soft and fluffy. The taste of the truffle also did not overpower the dish.\n\nEven though the price is on the more expensive side, I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a conducive environment to get work done and to eat hearty meals.",

I am not a coffee drinker, so for them to have lots of non-coffee drink options is definitely a plus point for me. I ordered the rose milk tea and i feel that it\u2019s very nice! (See photo for reference) the only downside is that they put a lot of rose petals into the drink, so you\u2019d need to chew the petals. However, this place is perfect if you wanna chill and talk with your friends. Also a recommended if you want to just work and have nice drinks and food.\nI haven\u2019t yet to try their main courses, but I\u2019m definitely looking forward to it\u2019",

Carrot cake abit dry, smoked duck abit tough to cut, sandwich could be cut into smaller pieces to be easier to eat, lobster bisque was average. You have to pay at the counter, there is free flow cold drinks. Would come again to try the other dishes and bakery.",

I also ordered a Grandma Lee(?) congee (being an old school local who likes his breakfast savoury), and it is definitely a hidden gem that is packed full of protein (chicken breast meat, I reckon) and uber tasty. I might go back alone some morning just for that. Aside from that, it was helpful that they had books and a wire puzzle thingy which helped kept the kid and toddler engaged for a bit (long enough for us to quickly eat before handling the restless toddler again). Will be back again... when the wife has her craving.",

Patronised a few cafes, but the food here at Ritual is really well done! Accompanied with the pretty, cosy interior. Suitable to do work here:) Came at the opening hour, and the cafe isn\u2019t open, so hope it will be more consistent with what they put on their google page! That aside, happy to give them 5 stars this time!!\n\n1st Visit:\nIt's a really pretty cafe tucked, just next to Stevens MRT. Happened to just hop in and get some work done, I've a huge thing for interiors, coupled with their LOFI and menu choice of different juices was really happy to come here.\n\nHowever, when I wanted to stay here longer at 6PM, the cashier did not inform me when I ordered more food then, that it would be the last order or if their cafe was closing soon. I had a very important video call coming in, and wasn't able to move away from my seat, later than to be reminded by the staff I had to leave. I later checked the cafe closes at 6PM, but the staff mention 6.30pm. Felt was an unpleasant experience for me, although also may have caused some inconveniences to the cafe staff. I hope The Ritual's customer service would continue to improve by going the mile to inform customer of its last order so they won't have to rush their food.\n\nbesides that I truly like it's ambience, and it's fresh ingredients, and portion, look forward to a better experience next visit!",

The portion was generous, and each component was cooked to perfection.\n\nTruffle Fries: Crispy, flavorful, and indulgent. The truffle oil added a rich, earthy aroma that elevated the dish.\n\nPasta: I opted for the pasta of the day, which was cooked al dente and tossed in a savory sauce. The flavors were well-balanced, and the portion was generous.\n\nIced Cafe Latte: A refreshing, well-crafted coffee",

So glad a colleague suggested we come here. Tried the Mama Lee Sambal Pasta and loved it. Came back today for it, but it's sold out! Tried the corn chowder, a monthly special, which was good too, but maybe I like my soups less creamy. The space manages to be both buzzy and comforting at the same time. Maybe it's the sunny yellow \ud83d\udc9b  Can see myself coming back here to hide out if i need to get some work done.",

Their seasonal menu also never fails to amaze us. Last month\u2019s Hainanese Pork Cutlet Curry & this month\u2019s XXL Mala Chicken Bowl both blew our minds. You could feel the love and care behind every dish and that they don\u2019t skimp on high quality ingredients. Thumbs up to the friendly crew as well. Truly a great place for a weekly winding down ritual.",

There are many seats and counter seats.\n\nThere is a wide variety of menus, from bakery items such as croissants to meal menus such as salads and pasta, so you can choose according to your stomach condition.\n\nThis time I had time, so I ordered scones to fill my stomach. It was a crispy scone that went well with the butter and jam, which I liked. satisfaction.\n\nThe drink menu also has a variety of drinks, from coffee to smoothies. I've only ever ordered black coffee, but this coffee is refreshing and doesn't have a strong acidity, so I like it because it's easy to drink.\n\nBest of all, the staff always greet me with a friendly smile, even when a casual old lady walks in alone, making the food even more delicious!\n\n\nIt's in the store.",
